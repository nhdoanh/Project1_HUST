       "['Ad sales boost Time Warner profit\\n \\n Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (Â£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.\\n \\n The firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales. TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.\\n \\n Time Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine Google. But its own internet business, AOL, had has mixed fortunes. It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. However, the company said AOL\\'s underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL\\'s existing customers for high-speed broadband. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.\\n \\n Time Warner\\'s fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts\\' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. \"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.\\n \\n TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators. It has already offered to pay $300m to settle charges, in a deal that is under review by the SEC. The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves, which it previously set at $500m. It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann\\'s purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue. It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake.\\n',\n",
       " 'Dollar gains on Greenspan speech\\n \\n The dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.\\n \\n And Alan Greenspan highlighted the US government\\'s willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan\\'s speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data. \"I think the chairman\\'s taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he\\'s taken for some time,\" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. \"He\\'s taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\"\\n \\n Worries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. China\\'s currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency\\'s sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing\\'s policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the \"time is ripe\" for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve\\'s decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US\\'s yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.\\n',\n",
       " 'Yukos unit buyer faces loan claim\\n \\n The owners of embattled Russian oil giant Yukos are to ask the buyer of its former production unit to pay back a $900m (Â£479m) loan.\\n \\n State-owned Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by Russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against Yukos. Yukos\\' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets. Rosneft already faces a similar $540m repayment demand from foreign banks. Legal experts said Rosneft\\'s purchase of Yugansk would include such obligations. \"The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets,\" said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case. Menatep Group\\'s managing director Tim Osborne told the Reuters news agency: \"If they default, we will fight them where the rule of law exists under the international arbitration clauses of the credit.\"\\n \\n Rosneft officials were unavailable for comment. But the company has said it intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk. Yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale.\\n',\n",
       " 'High fuel prices hit BA\\'s profits\\n \\n British Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits.\\n \\n Reporting its results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of Â£75m ($141m) compared with Â£125m a year earlier. Rod Eddington, BA\\'s chief executive, said the results were \"respectable\" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by Â£106m or 47.3%. BA\\'s profits were still better than market expectation of Â£59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.\\n \\n To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.\\n \\n In October, it increased this from Â£6 to Â£10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from Â£2.50 to Â£4 a leg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA\\'s estimated annual surcharge revenues - Â£160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra Â£250m. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to Â£1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. \"For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,\" BA chairman Martin Broughton said. BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.\\n \\n It also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA\\'s latest quarterly results as \"pretty modest\". \"It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,\" he said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. \"Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products,\" Mr Eddington said. \"For example, we have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds.\" BA\\'s shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.\\n',\n",
       " \"Pernod takeover talk lifts Domecq\\n \\n Shares in UK drinks and food firm Allied Domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by France's Pernod Ricard.\\n \\n Reports in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times suggested that the French spirits firm is considering a bid, but has yet to contact its target. Allied Domecq shares in London rose 4% by 1200 GMT, while Pernod shares in Paris slipped 1.2%. Pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics.\\n \\n Pernod's last major purchase was a third of US giant Seagram in 2000, the move which propelled it into the global top three of drinks firms. The other two-thirds of Seagram was bought by market leader Diageo. In terms of market value, Pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than Allied Domecq, which has a capitalisation of Â£5.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros). Last year Pernod tried to buy Glenmorangie, one of Scotland's premier whisky firms, but lost out to luxury goods firm LVMH. Pernod is home to brands including Chivas Regal Scotch whisky, Havana Club rum and Jacob's Creek wine. Allied Domecq's big names include Malibu rum, Courvoisier brandy, Stolichnaya vodka and Ballantine's whisky - as well as snack food chains such as Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins ice cream. The WSJ said that the two were ripe for consolidation, having each dealt with problematic parts of their portfolio. Pernod has reduced the debt it took on to fund the Seagram purchase to just 1.8bn euros, while Allied has improved the performance of its fast-food chains.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Japan narrowly escapes recession\\n \\n Japan\\'s economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to September, figures show.\\n \\n Revised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter. On an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought. A common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.\\n \\n The government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data. \"I maintain the view that Japan\\'s economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully,\" said economy minister Heizo Takenaka. But in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead, observers were less sanguine. \"It\\'s painting a picture of a recovery... much patchier than previously thought,\" said Paul Sheard, economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. Improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand, with private consumption up just 0.2% in the third quarter.\\n',\n",
       " 'Jobs growth still slow in the US\\n \\n The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.\\n \\n According to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs in January. The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November\\'s Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year\\'s election. However, when adding December and January\\'s figures, the administration\\'s first term jobs record ended in positive territory.\\n \\n The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.\\n \\n Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. \"It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,\" said Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group. \"We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment.\" \"The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,\" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. \"That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.\"\\n',\n",

He objected to subsidies on agriculture that make it hard for developing nations like India to compete. He also called for reform of the United Nations, the World Bank and the IMF.\\n \\n Palaniappan Chidambaram, India\\'s finance minister, argued that these organisations need to take into account the changing world order, given India and China\\'s integration into the global economy. He said the issue is not globalisation but \"the terms of engagement in globalisation.\" Mr Chidambaram is attending the G7 meeting as part of the G20 group of nations, which account for two thirds of the world\\'s population. At a conference on developing enterprise hosted by UK finance minister Gordon Brown on Friday, he said that he was in favour of floating exchange rates because they help countries cope with economic shocks. \"A flexible exchange rate is one more channel for absorbing both positive and negative shocks,\" he told the conference. India, along with China, Brazil, South Africa and Russia, has been invited to take part in the G7 meeting taking place in London on Friday and Saturday. China is expected to face renewed pressure to abandon its fixed exchange rate, which G7 nations, in particular the US, have blamed for a surge in cheap Chinese exports. \"Some countries have tried to use fixed exchange rates. I do not wish to make any judgements,\" Mr Chidambaram said. Separately, the IMF warned on Thursday that India\\'s budget deficit was too large and would hamper the country\\'s economic growth, which it forecast to be around 6.5% in the year to March 2005. In the year to March 2004, the Indian economy grew by 8.5%.\\n',\n",

Good rains, increased use of fertilizers and improved seeds contributed to the rise in production. Nevertheless, 2.2 million Ethiopians will still need emergency assistance.\\n \\n The report calculated emergency food requirements for 2005 to be 387,500 tonnes. On top of that, 89,000 tonnes of fortified blended food and vegetable oil for \"targeted supplementary food distributions for a survival programme for children under five and pregnant and lactating women\" will be needed.\\n \\n In eastern and southern Ethiopia, a prolonged drought has killed crops and drained wells. Last year, a total of 965,000 tonnes of food assistance was needed to help seven million Ethiopians. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) recommend that the food assistance is bought locally. \"Local purchase of cereals for food assistance programmes is recommended as far as possible, so as to assist domestic markets and farmers,\" said Henri Josserand, chief of FAO\\'s Global Information and Early Warning System. Agriculture is the main economic activity in Ethiopia, representing 45% of gross domestic product. About 80% of Ethiopians depend directly or indirectly on agriculture.\\n',\n",

The court in Washington found that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws. Among the accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. In its case, the government claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction, targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns, lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary.\\n \\n Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to surrender $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products. But the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the US government could not sue the firms under legislation drawn up to counteract Mafia infiltration of business. The tobacco companies deny that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public. They also say they have already met many of the government's demands in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998. Shares of tobacco companies closed higher after the ruling, with Altria rising 5% and Reynolds showing gains of 4.5%.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Ask Jeeves tips online ad revival\\n \\n Ask Jeeves has become the third leading online search firm this week to thank a revival in internet advertising for improving fortunes.\\n \\n The firm's revenue nearly tripled in the fourth quarter of 2004, exceeding $86m (Â£46m). Ask Jeeves, once among the best-known names on the web, is now a relatively modest player. Its $17m profit for the quarter was dwarfed by the $204m announced by rival Google earlier in the week. During the same quarter, Yahoo earned $187m, again tipping a resurgence in online advertising.\\n \\n The trend has taken hold relatively quickly. Late last year, marketing company Doubleclick, one of the leading providers of online advertising, warned that some or all of its business would have to be put up for sale. But on Thursday, it announced that a sharp turnaround had brought about an unexpected increase in profits. Neither Ask Jeeves nor Doubleclick thrilled investors with their profit news, however. In both cases, their shares fell by some 4%. Analysts attributed the falls to excessive expectations in some quarters, fuelled by the dramatic outperformance of Google on Tuesday.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Indonesians face fuel price rise\\n \\n Indonesia\\'s government has confirmed it is considering raising fuel prices by as much as 30%.\\n \\n Millions of Indonesians use kerosene for basic cooking, and prices have been heavily subsidised for years. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono\\'s government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor. But critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help. Millions of people were left homeless in Indonesia Aceh\\'s region following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in late December.\\n \\n Indonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices, but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down. It spent 59.2 trillion rupiah ($6.58bn; Â£3.5bn) on fuel subsidies in 2004, a sum far in excess of its original projection of 14.5 trillion rupiah. Since President Yudhoyono\\'s government came to power in October, it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies. \"The (January to March) quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices,\" said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, State Minister for National Development Planning. \"We are still considering if a 30% hike is suitable at the moment. The sooner the better for the state budget.\" The BBC\\'s correspondent in Jakarta, Rachel Harvey, told World Business Report that there was likely to be a strong public reaction to any price rise. \"The big question is whether they go for one big, short, sharp shock and raise prices between 20% and 30% or whether they try to stagger it,\" she said. Indonesia\\'s previous government, led by President Megawati Sukarnoputri, also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003, but was forced to back down in the face of public protests.\\n',\n",

The alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings and poor sales. The SUVs will be built in Japan using Peugeot's diesel engines and sold mainly in the European market. Falling sales have left Mitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.\\n \\n In January, Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine months, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March 2005. Its sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. As a result, the Japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. Last month it said it was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; Â£2.77bn) in fresh financial backing, half of it from other companies in the Mitsubishi group. US-German carmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, decided in April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was celebrated by Mitsubishi's newly-appointed chief executive Takashi Nishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm's troubles. Mitsubishi Motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to March 2005. Last month, it signed a production agreement with Japanese rival Nissan Motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in Japan. It has been making cars for Nissan since 2003.\\n\",\n",

Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. The cuts come against a background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising. The National Union of Journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on Monday or face a strike ballot.\\n \\n Pearson\\'s Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters.\\n \\n The National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike. \"Managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities,\" said Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary. NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. \"They have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members,\" said Mr Fitzpatrick, who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.\\n \\n Some broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines, which are hitting revenues. The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size.\\n \\n The Guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe. The Telegraph Group was bought by the Barclay twins - Frederick and David - last year, having previously been owned by Lord Conrad Black\\'s Hollinger International. The brothers are currently mulling the sale of another of their businesses, retailer Littlewoods.\\n \\n Telegraph executive Murdoch MacLennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months.\\n \\n \"Journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper, and maintaining the quality of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for our readers is vital,\" he said. \"However, action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital.\" Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages, or in some cases, have colour on every page. They are hoping that by boosting colour it will make their publications more attractive to advertisers and readers alike. In recent months News Corp\\'s News International unit, which publishes The Sun and the News of the World, the Guardian Media Group, Trinity Mirror and the Daily Mail & General Trust have all announced substantial investments in new printing plants.\\n',\n",
       " 'Air passengers win new EU rights\\n \\n Air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.\\n \\n New EU rules set compensation at between 250 euros (Â£173) and 600 euros, depending on the length of the flight. The new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines. Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost. The European Commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA) and the other from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has attacked the package as a \"bad piece of legislation\". Previously, passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding.\\n \\n However, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.\\n \\n The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. Overbooking can often lead to \\'bumping\\' - when a passenger is moved to a later flight. When this happens against a passenger\\'s will, airlines will now have to offer compensation. In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.\\n \\n However, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to \"extraordinary circumstances\". Airlines fear that \"extraordinary circumstances\" may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday. Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. \"It\\'s a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,\" Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley told Radio 4\\'s Today programme.\\n \\n The European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes. Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.\\n \\n EC spokeswoman Marja Quillinan-Meiland conceded there were \"grey areas\" but said \"these are not as big as the airlines are making out\". In cases of dispute, national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case, she said. New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added. The ERAA\\'s Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers. \"We reckon it\\'s going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that\\'s over Â£1bn a year loaded onto European passengers,\" Mr Clarke said. \"That\\'s basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted.\"\\n \\n On Wednesday, Jacques Barrot, vice president of the European Commission and also Commissioner for Transport, said that the changes were necessary. \"The boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers\\' right.\" \"This is a concrete example of how the Union benefits people\\'s daily lives,\" he added. The EC has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.\\n',\n",
       " 'China keeps tight rein on credit\\n \\n China\\'s efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005, state media report.\\n \\n The curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China\\'s manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a \"hard landing\" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China\\'s yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be taking effect. Industrial output grew 15.7% in the year to October, down from 23% in February, and inflation slowed to 4.3% - although retail sales are still booming.\\n',\n",

Less welcome was the news that the firm had been fined 11m euros for having violated takeover rules five years ago. The firm sought bankruptcy protection in December 2003 after disclosing a 4bn-euro hole in its accounts. Overall, the company's debt is close to 12bn euros, and is falling only slowly. Its brands, well-known in Italy and overseas, have continued to perform strongly, however, and have barely lost revenue since the scandal broke.\\n \\n But a crucial factor for the company's future is the legal unwinding of its intensely complex financial position. On Tuesday, the company's administrator, turnaround expert Enrico Bondi, sued Morgan Stanley, its former banker, to return 136m euros relating to a 2003 bond deal. That brought to 49 the number of banks that Mr Bondi has sued, a mass of legal action that could bring in as much as 3bn euros. The company has also sued former auditors and financial advisors for damages. And criminal cases against the company's former management are proceeding separately.\\n\",\n",

The government hopes to increase the number of mobile users from 95 million to between 200 and 250 million by 2007. \"We need at least $20bn (Â£10.6bn) in investment and part of this has to come as foreign direct investment,\" said Mr Maran. The decision to raise the limit for foreign investors faced considerable opposition from the communist parties, which give crucial support to the coalition headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Potential foreign investors will however need government approval before they increase their stake beyond 49%, Mr Maran said. Key positions, such as those of chief executive, chief technology officer and chief financial officer are to be held by Indians, he added.\\n \\n Analysts and investors have welcomed the government decision. \"It is a positive development for carriers and the investment community, looking to take a longer-term view of the huge growth in the Indian telecoms market,\" said Gartner\\'s principal analyst Kobita Desai. \"The FDI relaxation coupled with rapid local market growth could really ignite interest in the Indian telecommunication industry,\" added Ernst and Young\\'s Sanjay Mehta.

       " 'Call centre users \\'lose patience\\'\\n \\n Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.\\n \\n Once past the welcome message, callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music. The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. \"Customers are getting used to the idea of an \\'always available\\' society,\" says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey. However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year. When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. One possible reason for the lack in patience, Ms Diemont says, is the fact that more customers are calling \\'on the move\\' using their mobile phones.\\n \\n The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres\\' growing range of tasks. \"Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts,\" Ms Diemont says. Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training, the survey found.\\n \\n In what Dimension Data calls an \"alarming development\", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving \"agents not equipped to deal with customers\". This, Ms Diemont warns, is \"scary\" and not good for the bottom line either. Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. As a result, call centres have a high \"churn rate\", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. Resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer\\'s query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%. When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but that is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate.\\n \\n Suggestions that \"outsourcing\" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.\\n \\n There are \"no big differences in wait time and call resolution\" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world. \"You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place,\" she says. However, companies that decide to \"offshore\" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. Only 42% of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres. They give three key reasons for not making the move:\\n \\n - call centre operations are part of their business \"core function\", \\n  - they are worried about the risk of going abroad, \\n  - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive. The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents. What are your experiences with call centres? Are you happy to listen to Vivaldi or Greensleeves, or do you want an immediate response? And if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job?\\n',\n",
       " \"Rank 'set to sell off film unit'\\n \\n Leisure group Rank could unveil plans to demerge its film services unit and sell its media business, reports claim.\\n \\n Rank, formerly famous for the Carry On series, will expose the shake-up at the announcement of its results on Friday, the Sunday Telegraph reported. Advisors Goldman Sachs are understood to have valued its demerged Deluxe Film unit at Â£300m, the report added. Speculation of a possible shake-up has mounted since Rank announced a study into a possible demerger in September. Since Mike Smith's appointment as chief executive in 1999, the group has focused on fewer businesses and embarked on a major cost-cutting programme which has seen it dispose of a number of businesses, including the Odeon cinema chain and the Pinewood studios. The move left the group with three core divisions: gaming, Hard Rock and Deluxe Films, which provides technical services to Hollywood studios.\\n \\n Rank now aims to concentrate on its gaming, bars and hotels business, including extending its Hard Rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success. It also owns Deluxe Media, which makes and distributes DVDs and videos. However, that business is seen as less successful. Last year it made profits of Â£21.5m on a turnover of Â£392.1m and experts suggest its success in moving to DVDs from VHS video could make it an attractive target for a private equity buyer. A spokesman for the firm refused to comment on the reports, but said any results from the demerger study were likely to be set out when it unveiled its results on Friday. Analysts predict the firm is likely to report a slight drop in annual pre-tax profits to Â£170m from Â£194m last year. Formed in the 1940s the firm was a leading UK film producer and cinema owner for many years. It has now diversified into a range of other leisure activities - mainly in the UK - including hotels, roadside service areas and holiday centres. It now owns 34 Grosvenor casinos, the Mecca Bingo chain and more than 100 Hard Rock Cafes in 38 countries.\\n\",\n",

The seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller rise than expected, as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect. But officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market. \"There are clear signs of a revival in domestic demand,\" said Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labour Agency, in a statement. \"But growth of 0.1%... in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market.\" High oil prices and the soaring euro - which damages the competitiveness of exporters - were also having a negative effect, he said. The brunt of the unemployment is still being felt in the eastern part of Germany, where the rate is 18.8%.\\n \\n With unemployment stuck above 4 million for years, the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda. A controversial package of measures to shake up incentives to get back to work, paid for by cutting some cherished benefits, has sparked anger among some German workers. Strikes in a number of industries, notably among the country\\'s iconic carmakers, have demonstrated the displeasure - as well as fears about further job losses as outsourcing takes hold. Among the new initiatives are the so-called \"one-euro jobs\" which top up unemployment benefit. The scheme\\'s formal launch is January, but hirings for these positions are already taking place and affecting the unemployment statistics, economists said. \"The deterioration of the labour market does not come as a surprise,\" said Isabelle Kronawitter at Hypovereinsbank. \"Job creation measures probably prevented a stronger increase in the seasonally adjusted numbers.\"\\n',\n",

If confirmed, that would be the best quarterly showing since early 2002. It leaves GDP up 2.3% for the full year, but short of the 2.5% which the French government had predicted.\\n \\n Despite the apparent shortfall in annual economic growth, the good quarterly figures - a so-called \"flash estimate\" - mark a continuing trend of improving indicators for the health of the French economy. The government is reiterating a 2.5% target for 2005, while the European Central Bank is making positive noises for the 12-nation eurozone as a whole. Also on Friday, France\\'s industrial output for December was released, showing 0.7% growth. \"The numbers are good,\" said David Naude, economist at Deutsche Bank. \"They send a positive signal of a rebound in output... and open the way for a continuation in that trend into the New Year.\" Service sector activity improved in January, hitting a seven-month high.

The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country. However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to Â£56.4bn. The US consumer\\'s appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush\\'s economic policies.\\n \\n Democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. For example, they believe China\\'s currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China\\'s rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors.\\n \\n Meanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods. Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn, reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. Imports were not affected by the dollar\\'s weakness last year. \"We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,\" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.\\n',\n",

The court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of Yugansk, which Yukos claims was illegally sold. Separately, former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky began testimony on Friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion.\\n \\n Mr Khodorkovsky - who has been in jail for more than a year - pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities. \"I pride myself on heading for 15 years a number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees,\" he told a Russian court.\\n \\n Yugansk was auctioned to help pay off $27.5bn (Â£14.5bn) in unpaid taxes. It was bought for $9.4bn by a previously-unknown group, which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state-controlled oil company Rosneft.\\n \\n Texas Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of a US presence to establish US jurisdiction. \"The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia,\" Judge Clark said in her ruling. \"Such activities require the continued participation of the Russian government.\" Yukos had argued that a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore lives in Houston. Yukos claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. Russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the US courts.\\n \\n In her ruling, the judge acknowledged that \"it appears likely that agencies of the Russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under United States law\". But she said her role was simply to decide on jurisdiction. The US court\\'s jurisdiction had been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft. Analysts said the ability of Gazprom and Rosneft to trade freely overseas had been stifled while the ownership of Yugansk remained unclear.\\n \\n Yukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling. However, it claimed that the court had backed its argument in four out of five key issues. \"We believe the merits of our case are strong and simple,\" said chief executive Steven Theede. \"Our assets were illegally seized. We want them back or damages paid.\"\\n',\n",

This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said. Those vehicles with potential faults are the Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC Savana, Sierra and Yukon.\\n \\n The NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. GM is also recalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. However, GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. News of the recall follows an announcement last month that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. The world's biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European business, weak US sales and now a product recall. In January, GM said higher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005.\\n\",\n",

The IEA raised its estimate of 2005 oil demand growth by 80,000 barrels a day to 84 million barrels a day. US light crude rose $1.64 to $47.10, while Brent crude in London gained $1.32 to $44.45.\\n \\n The Paris-based IEA watchdog, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy, said the upward revision was due to stronger demand from China and other Asian countries. The fresh rally in crude prices followed gains on Wednesday which were triggered by large falls in US crude supplies following a cold spell in North America in January. The US Department of Energy reported that crude stockpiles had fallen 1m barrels to 294.3m. On top of that, ongoing problems for beleaguered Russian oil giant Yukos have also prompted the IEA to revise its output estimates from Russia - a major non-Opec supplier. \"I think that prices are now beginning to set a new range and it looks like the $40 to $50 level,\" said energy analyst Orin Middleton of Barclays Capital.\\n',\n",

The government is cracking down on so-called latifundios, or large rural estates, which it says are lying idle. The Vestey Group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure.\\n \\n The firm, whose Agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in Venezuela, insisted that it had complied fully with Venezuelan law. Prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted Hato El Charcote, a beef cattle ranch owned by Agroflora. According to Reuters, they plan to seize 12,900 acres (5,200 hectares) from the 32,000 acre (13,000 hectare) farm.\\n \\n Officials claim that Agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question. They also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production. \"The legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus,\" state prosecutor Alexis Ortiz told Reuters. \"As a consequence the government has taken action.\"\\n \\n Controversial reforms passed in 2001 give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the 19th Century.\\n \\n Critics say the powers - which President Chavez argues are needed to help the country\\'s poorest citizens and develop the Venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights. The Vestey Group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities. But a spokesman added: \"Agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land.\" The company pointed out that the farm, which employs 300 workers, provides meat solely for the Venezuelan market.\\n \\n Last month, the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40,000. The authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had \"nothing to fear\".

US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum.\\n \\n Forecasts for Japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005.

Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006. \"There are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future,\" said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the OECD\\'s chief economist. The price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late October.\\n \\n A dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said. \"The oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters,\" Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC\\'s World Business Report. \"The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.\" China\\'s booming economy and a \"spectacular comeback\" in Japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the OECD said. \"Supported by strong balance sheets and high profits, the recovery of business investment should continue in North America and start in earnest in Europe,\" it added. However, the report warned: \"It remains to be seen whether continental Europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand.\" The OECD highlighted current depressed household expenditure in Germany and the eurozone\\'s over-reliance on export-led growth.\\n',\n",

However, this is expected to be a formality. Sumitomo may now turn its attention to deepening its ties with Daiwa Securities, another Japanese financial firm. The two are set to merge their venture capital operations and there has been speculation that this could lead to a full-blown merger. Japanese banks are increasingly seeking alliances to boost profits.\\n',\n",

But it also found 12.1 trillion pesos was going to the richest part of the population, rather than to those in need. Sound distribution of the cash could cut poverty levels to 36% from 53%, the government believes. \"Resources are more than enough to reduce poverty and there is no need for more tax reforms but a better distribution,\" deputy planning director Jose Leibovich said.\\n \\n Colombia has a population of about 44 million and half lives below poverty line. However, some large properties are paying less in tax as they are situated inside poor areas, which benefit from cheaper utilities such as electricity and water, government research found. Government expenditure in areas such as pensions, public services, education, property and health should be revised, Mr Leibovich said. He added that the government is now examining the report, but warned there would be no easy solution to the problem. With a good distribution of such subsidies and economic growth of just 2%, by 2019 poverty could fall as low as 15.3%, he said.\\n',\n",

He said investment in new models was needed to ensure the future of the Birmingham plant. \"This is a very crucial and delicate time and our efforts are targeted to securing new models for the company which will mean jobs for our people,\" he said. SAIC says none of its money will be paid to the four owners of Rover, who have been accused by unions of awarding themselves exorbitant salaries, the FT reports. \"SAIC is extremely concerned to ensure that its money is used to invest in the business rather than be distributed to the shareholders,\" the newspaper quotes a source close to the Chinese firm. Meanwhile, according to Chinese state press reports, small state-owned carmaker Nanjing Auto is in negotiations with Rover and SAIC to take a 20% stake in the joint venture.

Many foreign firms had protested that the SEC was imposing an unfair burden. The new rules are the result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, part of the US clean-up after corporate scandals such as Enron and Worldcom. Section 404 of the Sox Act, as the legislation is nicknamed, calls for all firms to certify that their financial reporting is in line with US rules. Big US firms already have to meet the requirements, but smaller ones and foreign-based firms which list their shares on US stock markets originally had until the middle of this year.\\n \\n Over the past few months, delegations of European and other business leaders have been heading to the SEC\\'s Washington DC headquarters to protest. They say the burden is too expensive and the timescale too short and some, particularly the UK\\'s CBI, warned that companies would choose to let their US listings drop rather than get in line with section 404. The latest delegation from the CBI met SEC officials on Wednesday, just before the decision to relax the deadline was announced. \"I think this signifies a change of heart at the SEC,\" CBI director-general Sir Digby Jones told the BBC\\'s Today programme. \"They have been listening to us and to many overseas companies, who have reminded America what globalisation really means: that they can\\'t make these rules in isolation.\" The SEC said it had taken into consideration the fact that foreign companies were already working to meet more onerous financial reporting rules in their home countries. The European Union, in particular, was imposing new international financial reporting standards in 2005, it noted. \"I don\\'t underestimate the effort (compliance) will require... but this extension will provide additional time for those issuers to take a good hard look at their internal controls,\" said Donald Nicolaisen, the SEC\\'s chief accountant.\\n',\n",

His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\\n \\n There was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan\\'s most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country\\'s leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\\n \\n Mr Tsutsumi\\'s fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn\\'t let me use the silk futon, saying it\\'s a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan\\'s troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank\\'s bad loans.\\n',\n",

Umbro, which recently lost sponsorship deals with Chelsea and Celtic, said on Thursday it had signed a new four-year agreement with Scottish club Rangers. It hopes 2005 sales will benefit from the launch of a new England replica shirt ahead of the 2006 World Cup. In January, Umbro announced its sponsorship agreement with Chelsea, which gave Umbro the lucrative right to make replica shirts, would end in 2006, five years earlier than expected.

While the US economy is growing at a \"reasonably good pace\" he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the US. Pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy, he said.\\n \\n The government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby-boom generation retires. \"I fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver. If existing promises need to be changed, those changes should be made sooner rather than later,\" Mr Greenspan said. He also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity \"retirement and health programmes would need \"significant\" changes. He called on Congress to cut promised benefits for retirees, as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford.\\n \\n Meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added. He also urged Congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the US heading further into the red. Despite the dire warnings, Mr Greenspan did offer some good news for the short term. As US growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit. Recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely, which should cut some costs. Since President George W Bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of $412bn last year.\\n',\n",

The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\\n \\n The recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were Â£1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just Â£1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues.

Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, the de-facto ruler, told government departments to put plans in place for employing women. But progress has been slow, reports from the country say.\\n \\n Earlier this week, the local Arab News said Labour Minister Ghazi al-Gosaibi had \"caused uproar\" when he said his ministry was having difficulty hiring women because they demanded segregated offices. The newspaper said many Saudi women found his explanation \"a pitiful excuse for not employing women\".

       " 'Japan economy slides to recession\\n \\n The Japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade.\\n \\n Gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004. The fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending, and follows similar falls in GDP in the two previous quarters. The Tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year. On Wednesday, the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which, when taking into account performance in the most recent period, effectively tips Japan into recession.\\n \\n A previous estimate of 0.1% growth between July and September was downgraded to a 0.3% decline. A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, although the Japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy.\\n \\n Figures released by the government\\'s Cabinet Office showed that GDP, on an annualised basis, fell 0.5% in the last three months of 2004. However, politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year. \"The economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture, it is in a recovery stage,\" said Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Heizo Takenaka. Gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country. \"The economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at GDP alone,\" Mr Takenaka stressed.\\n \\n Ministers pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter. Analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that Japan\\'s largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise. Japan\\'s economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005. However, the economy\\'s fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies. \"The results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn\\'t be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy,\" said Naoki Iizuka, senior economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. Japan\\'s economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession.\\n',\n",

The gains tracked a surge in US gasoline futures to a record high of $1.4850 a gallon. The jump followed a fire at Western Refining Company\\'s refinery in Texas, which shut down petrol production. A spokesman for the group was unable to say when the production unit would be back up and running. \"This market simply wants to go up,\" Citigroup Global Markets analyst Kyle Cooper told Reuters news agency. Ed Silliere, analyst at Energy Merchant, added: \"Gasoline is up because of the refinery issues in Texas, which means there will be a scramble for product in the (US) Gulf Coast.\"\\n \\n Elsewhere, a refinery in Houston was closed due to mechanical problems, while on Tuesday production at BP\\'s Texas City refinery was taken down for a short time. In the approach to Spring, the market becomes much more sensitive to problems with petrol production as dealers anticipate rising demand for fuel ahead of the holiday season. The rise in prices came despite a US government report that showed domestic supplies of fuel oil and fuel were rising. Meanwhile, oil production cartel Opec\\'s recent announcement that it was now unlikely to cut production levels has also failed to calm fears on the market. Oil prices are roughly 45% higher than a year ago and have risen sharply in recent weeks due to a combination of colder weather, the declining value of the dollar and fears that Opec could rein in production to head off a seasonal drop in demand. Instability in Iraq and underlying fears about terrorism have also played a part in the rally.\\n',\n",

The economy has grown for six quarters but growth slowed dramatically in the last quarter amid weaker global demand. Japan\\'s government remains optimistic due to strong domestic demand.\\n \\n Analysts had been forecasting a 0.1% rise in month on month industrial output.\\n \\n According to figures from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the decline was led by a fall in demand for electronic parts for mobile phones and digital televisions. Although inventories fell 0.7% month on month, they were 36% higher than a year ago. \"It\\'s a sign that the economy\\'s adjustment phase is stronger than expected,\" said Takashi Yamanaka, an economist with UFJ Bank. Japan downgraded its overall economic assessment earlier this month for the first time in a year.\\n \\n Growth slowed to 0.3% in the quarter ending September 30, down from 6.3% in the first quarter of 2004. Experts believe the economy -which stagnated for most of the 1990s -may be entering a softer patch on the back of rising oil prices and the falling dollar. Japanese government officials played down the latest data, arguing that domestic consumer demand was still resilient. \"The outlook for November is positive so I don\\'t think one can say that conditions have worsened just because of the fall in October,\" said a METI official. Despite the rise in unemployment, jobless figures are still some way below historical highs of recent years. The comparatively weak economic date preyed on shares with the Nikkei down 1% in afternoon trade.\\n',\n",

Ryanair said the new planes would help it to cut operating costs further. The carrier reported a drop in quarterly profit earlier this year after it was hit by higher fuel costs. However, when it reported the results, the airline was upbeat about prospects for 2005, despite tough competition in the budget airline market.\\n \\n Ryanair chairman David Bonderman said that the 737-800 had \"significantly reduced our unit operating costs and allowed us to reduce air fares each year for the last five years\".\\n \\n \"With this new order and new pricing in place, Ryanair expects that unit operating costs (excluding fuel) will continue to fall each year for the next five years,\" he added. At the end of this year, Ryanair will have taken delivery of about 100 new planes, while the 70 new orders are due for delivery between 2008 and 2012. The airline said that when all these planes have been delivered, it will be able to carry more than 70 million passengers a year, making it Europe\\'s largest airline. About 2,500 new jobs should be created in the next seven years, it added.

Creditors of Parmalat, the main operating company, are likely to see the percentage of debt they receive fall from 7.3% to 6.9%.\\n \\n Several former top Parmalat executives are under investigation for the fraud scandal. Lawmakers said on Wednesday night Enrico Bondi, the turnaround specialist appointed by the Italian government as Parmalat\\'s chief executive, spoke positively about the company during a closed-door hearing of the Chamber of Deputies industry commission. \"Bondi supplied us with elements of positive results on the industrial positions and on the history of debt which will find a point of solution through the Parmalat group\\'s quotation on the market in July,\" Italian news agency Apcom quoted several lawmakers as saying in a statement.\\n',\n",
       " 'BMW cash to fuel Mini production\\n \\n Less than four years after the new Mini was launched, German car maker BMW has announced Â£100m of new investment.\\n \\n Some 200 new jobs are to be created at the Oxford factory, including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. The result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 cars from 2007. The rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. Before Wednesday\\'s announcement, BMW had invested some Â£280m in Mini production.\\n \\n Since its launch during summer 2001, the new Mini has gone from strength to strength.\\n \\n Last year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini. The company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. \"Our decision to produce a new Mini was not received well right away,\" said Norbert Reithofer, a member of the BMW management board. Initially, BMW said it would produce 100,000 Mini models a year at its vast Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again. Not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. \"The risk is that after they\\'ve invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new VW Beetle,\" said Brad Wernle, from Automotive News Europe.\\n \\n The price of the car has also gone up. When it was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than Â£10,000. These days, buyers will have to fork out almost Â£11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to Â£17,730. The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to Â£15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. Second-hand Minis are not cheap either. A Mini One bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least Â£8,000 for the cheapest model, while a used Cooper S is likely to be priced from Â£12,556, according to the-car buying website Parker\\'s. The consumers\\' association Which operates with slightly different numbers, yet it confirms that the Mini Cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car, other than the Mercedes Benz C180 SE and the BMW 1 Series 116i SE.\\n \\n The Cowley factory, which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100,000 Minis, is increasingly being put to good use.\\n \\n There are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. BMW\\'s Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for Â£10 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium. In 1999, when BMW still owned Rover, the Oxford factory was producing the award-winning Rover 75. During that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars. Last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 Mini-workers. The Mini factory\\'s current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars. Last year, MG Rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge. Indeed, Mini is not only producing more cars than MG Rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of Land Rovers and Range Rovers (which are made by the former Rover unit that BMW sold to Ford) are taken into account.\\n',\n",

However, Nestle\\'s profits margins were helped by a strong performance in the Americas and China. Nestle is to raise its dividend by 11% after paying back some of its debt.\\n \\n Nestle said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the US dollar, the disposal of businesses and challenging trading conditions in Europe all dented sales. A poor summer across the continent - in contrast to the prolonged heat wave in 2003 - \"severely affected\" demand for ice cream. Sales of bottled water also fell, although chocolate, coffee, frozen goods and petcare products performed better.\\n \\n Elsewhere, Nestle said it had enjoyed an \"exceptional\" year in North America, outperforming the market in terms of sales growth. Nestle added that it had performed strongly in Africa and Asia despite the impact of high oil prices and political instability. Nestle\\'s total earnings before interest remained broadly flat over the past year, despite the company managing to boost profit margins. As well as increasing its dividend, Nestle plans to buy back shares worth 1bn Swiss francs ($861m; Â£451m). Looking forward, Nestle forecasts organic earnings growth of about 5% in 2005, although it warned that trading would remain just as competitive.\\n \\n Uncertainty remains over the future of Perrier, the iconic French mineral water owned by Nestle. Perrier has been locked in a long-standing dispute with unions about productivity levels at the business, which has lead Nestle to consider selling the firm. \"The option of selling is Perrier is still on the table,\" chief executive Peter Brabeck-Letmathe confirmed on Thursday.\\n',\n",
       " \"Fiat mulls Ferrari market listing\\n \\n Ferrari could be listed on the stock market as part of an overhaul of Fiat's carmaking operations, the Financial Times has reported.\\n \\n It said Fiat was set to restructure its business after reaching a $2bn (1.53bn euros; Â£1.05bn) settlement with GM about Fiat's ownership. Steps being considered include listing Ferrari and bringing Maserati and Alfa Romeo closer together, it said. Despite strong sales of Alfa Romeo, Fiat's car business is making a loss.\\n \\n Under the proposals - which the paper said could be announced within days - the iconic sportscar maker could be listed separately on the market. Fiat owns a 56% stake in Ferrari -best known for its dominant Formula One motor racing team - having first bought into the business in 1969. It considered floating Ferrari in 2002 but opted to sell a minority stake to Italian bank Mediobanca for 775m euros ($1bn). That sale valued Ferrari - which owns the Maserati brand - at 2.3bn euros. The price tag would change if Maserati was stripped out. The Financial Times said Fiat may transfer Maserati within its wholly- owned Alfa Romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies. Such a move would help Alfa Romeo and Maserati to share marketing, distribution and research & development costs. Maserati and Ferrari sell about 10,000 cars between them and both companies broke even in 2003.\\n \\n Fiat, Italy's largest private sector employer, did not comment on the reported changes. Fiat recently negotiated an end to its alliance with General Motors. The US firm agreed to pay $2bn to exit an agreement under which it could have been liable to buy Fiat outright. Analysts said the reported restructuring was evidence of the greater flexibility which Fiat now had to develop the business.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Italy to get economic action plan\\n \\n Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the country\\'s sputtering economy on Thursday night in Rome.\\n \\n He will present an \"Action Plan for the Development of Italy\" in a meeting with industrialists and trade union leaders. Mr Berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (R&D) spending, and the competitiveness of small firms. Also in focus will be bankruptcy laws and the slow pace of the legal system. The prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at 1830 GMT.\\n \\n The government has been accused of underfunding R&D, making it harder for Italy to compete with other European nations and leading to a \"brain-drain\" of the country\\'s brightest talents. Analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive, hampering the development of small- and medium-sized businesses. As a result, they say, Italy\\'s corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller companies that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of a larger firm. At the same time, bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts, a situation that is hampering Italy\\'s entrepreneurial spirit.\\n \\n The government says that it has set about tackling the problems, adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of Italy\\'s 60 million population. According to Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy\\'s business newspaper, the government will focus on \"opening up markets, infrastructure, research, making more incentives available, bankruptcy law, the slow pace of the justice system\".\\n \\n Mr Berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by 6.5bn euros ($8.6bn; Â£4.5bn) this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend. He has also promised to cap spending on transport, education and health so as to trim the ballooning budget deficit. Italy plans to raise as much as 25bn euros from privatisations in 2005, including a partial flotation of the post office and utility Enel. Critics argue that these moves do not go far enough and could make Italy\\'s problems worse. Limiting government spending will lead to job losses, they counter, while the income tax cuts will have a negligible effect on sentiment and ultimately favour the wealthy.\\n \\n The country has been one of the eurozone\\'s worst economic performers in recent years. Growth was 1.1% in 2004, up from just 0.3% in 2003 and 0.4% in 2002 - an improvement but still a long way from ideal. At the same time, business and consumer confidence has dipped and analysts have raised concerns that what little spending there is stems from Italians dipping into their savings accounts or using credit cards. Without a pick up in national growth, they say, the money could eventually run out, bringing Italy\\'s economy to a juddering halt. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of Italy\\'s economy.\\n',\n",

Reuters beat profit forecasts, posting a 52% rise in profits for the year to Â£198m from the Â£130m seen a year earlier. Reuters also beat its savings target for 2004, delivering Â£234m of cuts. Under its three-year Fast Forward turnaround plan it had aimed to save Â£220m during the 12 months to 31 December.\\n \\n Reuters also managed to slow a decline in underlying revenues to 5.4% from 10.2% in 2003 and cut its debt back to Â£160m from Â£610m a year earlier. The news and financial data seller said the year had begun well, adding it expected \"further gradual improvement\" in the second quarter of the year after good January sales. It added it was planning to deliver a further Â£105m of savings over the coming year - but said it expects to be hit with an Â£80m restructuring charge to pay for the cost of moving from Fleet Street to new headquarters in London at Canary Wharf. \"Improving customer relationships, more competitive products and continued strong cost discipline position us well for 2005,\" chief executive Tom Glocer said, adding the company was beginning \"to look beyond recovery to growth\".\\n',\n",

This will boost the annual production capacity of the company - India\\'s second-largest car manufacturer - to 400,000 units. Hyundai expects its sales in India to grow 16% to 250,000 in 2005. By 2010, it expects to nearly double sales to 400,000 cars. The new plant will be built close to the existing one in Chennai, in the southern province of Tamil Nadu.\\n \\n South Korea\\'s top car maker estimates that the Indian market will grow 15% this year, to 920,000 vehicles, reaching 1.6 million vehicles by 2010. Demand in India has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said. Figures show that currently only eight people per thousand are car owners. \"We desperately need to expand our production in order to meet growing demand in the Indian auto market, which is growing over 12 percent every year, and to top our competitors,\" chairman Chung Mong-koo said in the statement. He said the company plans to use India as a base for exports to Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The company - which controls half of the South Korean\\'s market - aims to become a global top five auto maker by 2010.\\n',\n",

The tax cuts target firms and individuals, cutting corporate tax from 30% to 29% and offering income tax cuts worth 6.8bn rand ($1.2bn; Â£910m). Spending on health and education will rise by 9.4% and 8.1% respectively. Spending on housing and sanitation will rise by 12%. All the spending increases will run over the next three years.\\n \\n Unveiling the 418bn-rand budget to parliament, Mr Manuel said the South African economy had grown by an average of 3.2% over the past four years, slightly below the African average of 4%.\\n \\n He predicted that the South African economy would grow by 4.3% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2006. Mr Manuel added that inflation fell to 4.3% in 2004 and is expected to remain at between 3% and 6% from now until at least 2008, helped by interest rates which are at their lowest level in 24 years. Given that both corporate and personal taxes are being cut - under the new measures, those earning less than 35,000 rand a year will be exempt from income tax - the extra 22.3bn rand in social spending will be partly met by higher fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes.\\n \\n \"In this budget, the focus is on more for all, not more for some, and not a hell of a lot more for a few, but spread across all of South Africa,\" said Mr Manuel. He said that the economic situation was a \"marked improvement\" on the position at the end of apartheid, but acknowledged that more needed to be done to improve the lives and livelihoods of the disadvantaged. About 280,000 jobs a year have been created in South Africa since 2000 but unemployment remains high, currently close to 30%. Economist Colen Garrow said the budget looked as if it would stimulate economic growth. \"It\\'s pleasant to see the cut in company taxes, it\\'s a good incentive for business,\" he said.\\n',\n",

The company, which is vying with Mercedes-Benz for the title of leading premium carmaker, is confident about its prospects for the region in 2005. It is launching a revamped version of its 3-Series saloon class next month.\\n \\n BMW sold nearly 95,000 cars in Asia last year, up 2.6% on 2003.\\n \\n BMW-brand sales rose 2.3% to 80,600 while sales of Mini models rose 3.6% to 14,800. There was also a significant increase in sales of Rolls-Royces on the continent. BMW sold more than 100 of the iconic models compared with just ten the previous year. The German carmaker is aiming to boost annual sales in Asia to 150,000 by 2008. \"Here in Asia, we consider a double-digit increase in retail on the order of 10 to 15% to be realistic on the basis of current features,\" said Helmut Panke, BMW\\'s group chief executive.\\n \\n China remains the main area of concern for BMW after sales there fell 16% last year. However, BMW is hopeful of a much better year in 2005 as its direct investment in China begins to pay dividends. The company only began assembling luxury high-powered sedans in China in 2003. 2004 was generally a good year for BMW, which saw revenues from its core car-making operations rise 11%.\\n',\n",
       " 'Economy \\'stronger than forecast\\'\\n \\n The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.\\n \\n Private sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\\n \\n The ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\\n \\n \"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\\n \\n A slowdown in the housing market and this year\\'s surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"\\n',\n",

It did not say which facilities would be affected, but intends moving them to Asia, eastern Europe and Mexico. The company has two manufacturing sites in County Durham. It makes lawn and garden products in Newton Aycliffe, and cookers and ovens in Spennymoor. The Newton Aycliffe plant could also be affected by Electrolux\\'s separate announcement that it is to spin-off its outdoor products unit into a new separate company.\\n \\n Electrolux\\'s subsidiary brands include AEG, Zanussi and Frigidaire. The company said it was speeding up its restructuring programme, which aims to save between Â£190m and Â£265m annually from 2009. \"We see that about half the plants in high-cost countries - that is around 10 - are at risk,\" said Electrolux chief executive Hans Straberg. \"It looks pretty grim,\" said Swedish trades union official Ulf Carlsson. \"What are we going to end up producing in Sweden?\"\\n',\n",

Her warnings led to the collapse of the firm following the discovery of an $11bn (Â£5.7bn) accounting fraud. Mr Ebbers has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy.\\n \\n Prosecution lawyers have argued that Mr Ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at WorldCom, ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet Wall Street earnings estimates. But Ms Cooper, who now runs her own consulting business, told a jury in New York on Wednesday that external auditors Arthur Andersen had approved WorldCom\\'s accounting in early 2001 and 2002. She said Andersen had given a \"green light\" to the procedures and practices used by WorldCom. Mr Ebber\\'s lawyers have said he was unaware of the fraud, arguing that auditors did not alert him to any problems.\\n \\n Ms Cooper also said that during shareholder meetings Mr Ebbers often passed over technical questions to the company\\'s finance chief, giving only \"brief\" answers himself. The prosecution\\'s star witness, former WorldCom financial chief Scott Sullivan, has said that Mr Ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm, telling him to \"hit our books\". However, Ms Cooper said Mr Sullivan had not mentioned \"anything uncomfortable\" about WorldCom\\'s accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting. Mr Ebbers could face a jail sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as MCI.

The highest ranking executive pleading guilty on Tuesday was former Marsh senior vice president Joshua Bewlay.\\n \\n He admitted one felony count of scheming to defraud and faces up to four years in prison. A Marsh spokeswoman said Mr Bewlay was no longer with the company. Mr Spitzer\\'s investigation of the US insurance industry looked at whether companies rigged bids and fixed prices.

Average earnings rose by 4.3% in the year to December up from November\\'s 4.2%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) added. Meanwhile, the benefit claimant total fell 11,000 to 813,200 last month. Throughout 2004, the number of people in work increased by 296,000 to 28.52 million - the highest figure since records began in 1971.\\n \\n The apparent discrepancy between rising unemployment and record numbers in work can be explained by an increase in the working population and a fall in those who are economically inactive. While the UK\\'s jobless rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6% in the previous quarter, the rate still remains one of the lowest in the world, compared with 12.1% in Germany, 10.4% in Spain and 9.7% in France. But, despite more people being in work, the manufacturing sector continued to suffer, with 104,000 workers axed during the last quarter of 2004 - pushing employment in the sector to a record low of 3.24 million by the end of last year. The figures prompted some analysts to forecast that the Bank of England will almost certainly raise rates this year. Marc Ostwald, a strategist at Monument Securities told Reuters that while no immediate market impact could be expected, \"it is enough to underline that they (the BoE) will be more hawkish on rates\".\\n',\n",

Any profits would depend on the outcome of legal cases resulting from a change in steel contractor, it added. It cut A$68m from profit targets for Wembley and another UK project.\\n \\n Investors were shaken by the news and the firm\\'s shares fell to a four month low of A$4.50, before recovering to close 16% down at A$4.67. The decline came despite Multiplex reporting an 11% rise in pre-tax profits to A$67.7m for 2004 and reaffirming its 2005 profit forecasts. Increased costs at Wembley and a separate development in London\\'s Docklands saw Multiplex\\'s construction division report profits of A$35.1m.\\n \\n The firm said the result was below expectations but stressed that the majority of its UK projects - which also include the White City redevelopment scheme in west London - were performing strongly.\\n \\n To recoup any profit from Wembley, where the firm changed its steel contractor due to a legal dispute, Multiplex will have to win legal claims against subcontractors. These claims could take up to two years to resolve. \"Multiplex believes its claim are sound and ultimately will exceed the level needed to support the break even position,\" it said. \"It is expected that profits will be possible in future periods as the claims are finalised.\" Wembley Stadium is to due to be completed in January and will officially open for the 2006 FA Cup Final. Analysts expressed concern at the unexpected paring back in profit. \"Such a big writeback on the Wembley project in such a short period has impacted on management credibility,\" Simon Wheatley, from Goldman Sachs, told Reuters.\\n',\n",

Excluding the car sector, US retail sales were up 0.6% in January, twice what some analysts had been expecting. US retail spending is expected to rise in 2005, but not as quickly as in 2004.\\n \\n Steve Gallagher, US chief economist at SG Corporate & Investment Banking, said January\\'s figures were \"decent numbers\".\\n \\n \"We are not seeing the numbers that we saw in the second half of 2004, but they are still pretty healthy,\" he added. Sales at appliance and electronic stores were down 0.6% in January, while sales at hardware stores dropped by 0.3% and furniture store sales dipped 0.1%. Sales at clothing and clothing accessory stores jumped 1.8%, while sales at general merchandise stores, a category that includes department stores, rose by 0.9%. These strong gains were in part put down to consumers spending gift vouchers they had been given for Christmas.\\n \\n Sales at restaurants, bars and coffee houses rose by 0.3%, while grocery store sales were up 0.5%. In December, overall retail sales rose by 1.1%. Excluding the car sector, sales rose by just 0.3%. Parul Jain, deputy chief economist at Nomura Securities International, said consumer spending would continue to rise in 2005, only at a slower rate of growth than in 2004. \"Consumers continue to retain their strength in the first quarter,\" he said.

Flights were affected for an hour on Wednesday morning, double the time that had been expected, leading to cancellations and delays. Lufthansa accounts for six out of every 10 planes using Frankfurt\\'s airport.\\n \\n \"We are doing research into the possibilities we have,\" Michael Lamberty, a Lufthansa spokesman told the BBC. \"We are checking if there is action to be taken and in which courts it could be taken.\" Mr Lamberty explained that the company did not plan to pursue Germany\\'s air traffic controllers\\' organisation or the airport authority but wanted instead to see if it was possible to sue the German federal agencies that gave the orders. The company said that it had to cancel 77 short and medium-distance flights, affecting about 5,000 passengers. Long-haul travellers were not disrupted.\\n \\n Central to the problem was that instead of half an hour, the arrival of President Bush on the German leg of his European tour took the best part of an hour, Lufthansa said. During that time, restrictions were put on planes taxiing, taking off and landing at Frankfurt\\'s Rhein-Main airport. The extra time taken by President Bush and his entourage meant that there was a knock-on effect that led to significant delays. Mr Lamberty said that 92 outgoing flights and 86 income flights were delayed by an average of an hour following President Bush\\'s arrival, affecting almost 17,000 passengers. Despite the problems, Mr Lamberty said that it was not certain that Lufthansa would take legal action.\\n',\n",

The world\\'s richest countries have said they want to increase the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015. Airlines have reacted strongly against the proposed fuel levy.\\n \\n Profits have been under pressure in the airline industry, with low-cost firms driving down prices and demand dipping after the 11 September terrorist attacks and the outbreak of the killer SARS virus.\\n \\n Things have picked up, but some European and US companies are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. At present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in EU member states. \"Of course we applaud humanitarian initiatives, but why target the airlines?\" said Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, secretary general of the Association of European Airlines. \"Our industry is in the midst of a fundamental crisis...only to be once again confronted with a measure designed to increase our costs,\" he continued.\\n \\n The EU sought to allay the airlines\\' fears, stressing that Thursday\\'s meeting was only a first step and that other proposals were also under consideration. It added that any plan to levy taxes on jet fuel \"should not hinder the competitiveness of the airlines and that they themselves will not be solely funding development\". Any tax would only be implemented after full consultation with the airlines, the EU said. There is thought to be widespread support for the plan - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting of the world\\'s richest nations - from EU ministers. The issue of poverty in Africa and South Asia has forced itself to the top of the politicial agenda, with politicians and campaigners calling for more to be done.

The study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. Observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.\\n \\n \"We\\'re surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock,\" said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner. \"The main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak, particularly in the retail trade.\" Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February\\'s Ifo confidence figure \"a very mild decline\". He said that despite the retreat, the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected \"a modest economic upswing\" to continue.\\n \\n Germany\\'s economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. However, the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004, mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish. Exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas. On top of that, the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms, including DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Volkswagen, have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany\\'s continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise.\\n',\n",

As a result, the 2.5 billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity. The most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries. The FAO report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to 30 times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries.\\n \\n The FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries\\' access to the world market. It also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations. It recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation.\\n \\n According to the organisation, subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice. Global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the European Union and the US, who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices. In fact, almost 30 wealthy nations spend more than $300bn (Â£158.8bn; 230.9bn euros) in agricultural subsidies. The market situation has divided developing nations in two groups, the FAO said. The first group have a reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group, agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers. For 43 developing countries, more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product. These countries are mainly situated in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.\\n',\n",
       " 'India seeks to boost construction\\n \\n India has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in its construction sector.\\n \\n Kamal Nath, Commerce and Industry Minister, announced the decision in Delhi on Thursday following a cabinet meeting. Analysts say improving India\\'s infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too. The Indian government\\'s decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector, according to some Indian firms.\\n \\n A spokesman for DLF Builders, Dr Vancheshwar, told the BBC this will mean \"better offerings\" for consumers as well as builders. He said the firm will benefit from world class \"strategic partnerships, design expertise and technology, while consumers will have better choice.\"\\n \\n The government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the \\'automatic route\\' in the construction sector, on projects including housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals and educational establishments. The automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which can be bureaucratic. The government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers, and benefit steel and brick-making industries.\\n \\n Mr Nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired. \"Foreign investors can enter any construction development area, be it to build resorts, townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50,000 square meters (538,000 square feet) within a specific timeframe,\" said Mr Nath, without specifying the timeframe. Previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the Indian market. This measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively, without developing it. Anshuman Magazine, managing director, of CB Richard Ellis - an international real estate company - told the BBC this was \"a big positive step.\"\\n \\n However, Chittabrata Majumdar, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said allowing FDI in the country is compromising India\\'s own \"self reliance\". He said, \"No country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone.\" Mr Majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.\\n',\n",
       " 'Boeing unveils new 777 aircraft\\n \\n US aircraft firm Boeing has unveiled its new long-distance 777 plane, as it tries to regain its position as the industry\\'s leading manufacturer.\\n \\n The 777-200LR will be capable of flying almost 11,000 miles non-stop, linking cities such as London and Sydney. Boeing, in contrast to European rival Airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances. Airbus, which overtook Boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003, is focusing on so-called super jumbos.\\n \\n Analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between Boeing and Airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry. Boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world\\'s airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights.\\n \\n It is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777-200LR and its much-anticipated 787 Dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008. The 777-200LR, which had its launch delayed by the 11 September attacks in the US, is the fifth variation of Boeing\\'s twin-aisle 777 plane. The company offically \"rolled-out\" the new 777 in Seattle at 2200 GMT. Better fuel efficiency from engines made by GE and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide.\\n \\n \"Boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful,\" said David Learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International. But the 777-200LR \"is a niche player\", Mr Learmount continued, adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft. Mr Learmount pointed out that the 777-200LR has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders. He also said that while the plane may be able to fly to Sydney from London in one hit, prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.\\n \\n For Airbus, the future is big - it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports. From there, passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes. Airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft. It has been producing a rival to Boeing\\'s 777 line for more than a year. \"Airbus is now where Boeing was a few years ago\" with its product range, said Flight International\\'s Mr Learmount.\\n \\n Both Boeing and Airbus have been taking orders for their new planes. Boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200LR planes over the next 20 years. It already has orders from Pakistan International Airlines and EVA of Taiwan. These orders should help underpin the company\\'s profits. Boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a US air force 767 tanker contract. Net profit was $186m (Â£98m; 143m euros) in the quarter, compared with $1.13bn in the same period in 2003.\\n',\n",

Shares in the retailer were up 19.6% at $17.04 in Tuesday morning trading in New York following the announcement. Highfield said that it intends to take the Virginia-based firm private.\\n \\n \"Such a transformation would eliminate the public-company transparency into the company\\'s operating strategy that is uniquely damaging in a highly competitive industry where Circuit City is going head-to-head with a tough and entrenched rival,\" Highfield said. One analyst suggested that a bidding battle may now begin for the company. Bill Armstrong, a retail analyst at CL King & Associates, said he expected to see other private investment firms come forward for Circuit City. The retailer is debt free with a good cash flow, despite the fact that it is said to be struggling to keep up with market leader Best Buy and cut-price competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, said Mr Armstrong.\\n',\n",
       " 'Japan turns to beer alternatives\\n \\n Japanese brewers are increasingly making money from beer-flavoured drinks rather than beer itself\\n \\n Beer and spirits are heavily taxed in Japan, driving breweries to search for alternatives. Japan\\'s long economic downturn helped drive the trend, as drinkers looked for cheaper opportunities to drown their sorrows. Now, according to Asahi Breweries, the market for so-called \"beer-like\" drinks is set to grow 84% this year.\\n \\n Asahi is predicting profits to rise 50% in 2005 as it launches a drink based on soybean peptides rather than malt. The chosen name, \"Shinnama\" or \"new draft\", disguises its non-beer nature. But despite a record profit in 2004 of 30.6bn yen ($291m; Â£154m), up 31.8% on the previous year, Asahi is coming late to the market. Key rival Sapporo is already well-established with the beer-flavoured \"Draft One\". Suntory, meanwhile, is doing well with \"Super Blue\", which combines happoshu - an existing low-cost beer alternative made with malt and seawater - and shochu, a distilled alcohol derived from sweet potatoes or barley. Happoshu has been a mainstay of brewery profits for years, taking over from beer thanks to its low tax and therefore low cost. Kirin, the fourth big name, is launching its own \"third-type\" drink in April.\\n',\n",
       " 'S Korean consumers spending again\\n \\n South Korea looks set to sustain its revival thanks to renewed private consumption, its central bank says.\\n \\n The country\\'s economy has suffered from an overhang of personal debt after its consumers\\' credit card spending spree. Card use fell sharply last year, but is now picking up again with a rise in spending of 14.8% year-on-year. \"The economy is now heading upward rather than downward,\" said central bank governor Park Seung. \"The worst seems to have passed.\" Mr Park\\'s statement came as the bank decided to keep interest rates at an all-time low of 3.25%. It had cut rates in November to help revive the economy, but rising inflation - reaching 0.7% month-on-month in January - has stopped it from cutting further. Economic growth in 2004 was about 4.7%, with the central bank predicting 4% growth this year. Other indicators are also suggesting that the country is inching back towards economic health. Exports - traditionally the driver for expansion in Asian economies - grew slower in January than at any time in 17 months. But domestic demand seems to be taking up the slack. Consumer confidence has bounced back from a four-year low in January, and retail sales were up 2.1% in December. Credit card debt is falling, with only one in 13 of the 48 million cards now in default - down from one in eight at the end of 2003. One of its biggest card issuers, LG Card, was rescued from collapse in December, having almost imploded under the weight of its customers\\' bad debts. The government last year tightened the rules for card lending to keep the card glut under control.\\n',\n",
       " \"German growth goes into reverse\\n \\n Germany's economy shrank 0.2% in the last three months of 2004, upsetting hopes of a sustained recovery.\\n \\n The figures confounded hopes of a 0.2% expansion in the fourth quarter in Europe's biggest economy. The Federal Statistics Office said growth for the whole of 2004 was 1.6%, after a year of contraction in 2003, down from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. It said growth in the third quarter had been zero, putting the economy at a standstill from July onward. Germany has been reliant on exports to get its economy back on track, as unemployment of more than five million and impending cuts to welfare mean German consumers have kept their money to themselves. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. According to the statistics office, Destatis, rising exports were outweighed in the fourth quarter by the continuing weakness of domestic demand.\\n \\n But the relentless rise in the value of the euro last year has also hit the competitiveness of German products overseas. The effect has been to depress prospects for the 12-nation eurozone as a whole, as well as Germany. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but senior officials at the rate-setting European Central Bank are beginning to talk about the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise. The ECB's mandate is to fight rising prices by boosting interest rates - and that could further threaten Germany's hopes of recovery.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Turkey-Iran mobile deal \\'at risk\\'\\n \\n Turkey\\'s investment in Iran\\'s mobile industry looks set to be scrapped after its biggest mobile firm saw its investment there slashed by MPs.\\n \\n Iran\\'s parliament voted by a large majority to cut Turkcell\\'s stake in a new mobile network from 70% to 49%. The move, which was justified on national security grounds, follows an earlier vote by MPs to give themselves a veto over foreign investments. Turkcell said the decision \"increases the risks\" attached to the project. Although the company\\'s statement said it would continue to monitor developments, observers said they thought Turkcell was set to pull out of the $3bn deal. \"The possibility of carrying out this project is next to zero,\" said Atinc Ozkan, analyst at Finans Investment in Istanbul. If Turkcell does back out, MTN - the South African firm which lost out in the original tender - may well be back in the running. The company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if Iran will award it the mobile deal.\\n \\n Turkcell\\'s mobile deal is the second Turkish investment in Iran to run into trouble. Turkish-Austrian consortium TAV was chosen to build and run Tehran\\'s new Imam Khomeini International Airport - but the army closed it just hours after it opened in May 2004. In both cases, the justification has been national security, amid allegations that the Turkish firms are too close to Israel. The hardline posture taken by parliament, which is dominated by religious conservatives, could yet impact other inward investments.\\n',\n",
       " 'EU ministers to mull jet fuel tax\\n \\n European Union finance ministers are meeting on Thursday in Brussels, where they are to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax.\\n \\n A levy on jet fuel has been suggested as a way to raise funds to finance aid for the world\\'s poorest nations. Airlines and aviation bodies have reacted strongly against the plans, saying they would hurt companies at a time when earnings are under pressure. The EU said a tax would only be passed after full consultation with airlines. It was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the \"competitiveness of the airlines\". Ministers will also be discussing reforms to regulations governing European public spending.\\n \\n Global leaders have focused attention on poverty reduction and development at recent meetings of the G7 Group and World Economic Forum. The world\\'s richest countries have said they want to boost the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015. Many EU ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting. At present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in EU member states.\\n',\n",
       " 'Palestinian economy in decline\\n \\n Despite a short-lived increase in Palestinian jobs in 2003, the economy is performing well below its potential, said a World Bank report.\\n \\n Unemployment stood at 25%, compared with 10% before the uprising against Israeli occupation four years ago. Young people are particularly hard hit with 37% out of work, compared with 14% four years ago. But 104,000 new jobs were created last year during a brief easing of violence and closures. However, during the first half of this year, the Palestinian economy lost more than 22,000 jobs. Last year\\'s growth rate of 6% can also be attributed to this temporary gap in violence, the report said. According to the report, Intifada, Closures and Palestinian Economic Crisis: An Assessment, there is a close link between the number of closures - both border closures and internal closures between cities - and Palestinian economic problems. The closures arranged by Israel restrict the movement of Palestinian people and goods, slowing down trade.\\n \\n \"Closures are a key factor behind today\\'s economic crisis in the West Bank,\" said Nigel Roberts, World Bank country director for the West Bank and Gaza. Nearly half of all Palestinians - some 47% - live below the poverty line and are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks. The report said even more would be on the poverty line without an average of $950m a year from international donors, some of which goes towards job creation. It also called on the Palestinian Authority to revive its reform programme and maintain financial discipline to create an investment-friendly climate. This week Colin Powell, US Secretary of State was visiting the West Bank to stress US support for a smooth Palestinian election in January.\\n',\n",
       " 'China had role in Yukos split-up\\n \\n China lent Russia $6bn (Â£3.2bn) to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos, it has been revealed.\\n \\n The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks. The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China. The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China\\'s CNPC.\\n \\n According to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yugansk\\'s former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. \"The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,\" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan. \"There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.\"\\n \\n The announcements help to explain how Rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk. Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.\\n \\n The embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. But Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once the country\\'s richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.\\n \\n The deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China\\'s desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. China\\'s thirst for products such as crude oil, copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels. \"Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage [in Russia],\" said Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton. \"They understand property rights in Russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.\" \"If the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the Chinese,\" Mr Lukashov continued. \"And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash, so it\\'s a good deal for them too.\"\\n',\n",

GM, whose own European operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable Fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent Fiat shares down 1.2% on Tuesday, after Monday\\'s 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The US firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (Â£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by Fiat\\'s decision to sell off Fiat\\'s finance arm and halve GM\\'s stake via a capital-raising effort.\\n \\n The 2000 deal resulted from a race between GM and DaimlerChrysler to ally with Fiat. The German firm wanted to buy Fiat outright. But Gianni Agnelli, the godfather of the group, wanted to keep control, and preferred GM\\'s offer to buy a 20% stake and give Fiat the right to sell in the future, known as a \"put option\". Since then, however, Fiat cars have lost market share and the firm has piled up losses, while a plan to raise new money in 2003 cut GM\\'s stake in half to 10%. For its part, GM\\'s European units Opel and Saab have both had trouble, with Opel management threatening to cut 12,000 jobs. \"The last thing they need is additional production capacity in Europe,\" said Patrick Juchemich, auto analyst at Sal Oppenheim Bank.\\n',\n",
       " \"ID theft surge hits US consumers\\n \\n Almost a quarter of a million US consumers complained of being targeted for identity theft in 2004, official figures suggest.\\n \\n The Federal Trade Commission said two in five of the 635,173 reports it had from consumers concerned ID fraud. ID theft occurs when criminals use someone else's personal information to steal credit or commit other crimes. Internet auctions were the second biggest source of fraud complaints, comprising 16% of the total. The total cost of fraud reported by consumers was $546m (Â£290m).\\n \\n The report marks the fifth year in a row in which identity fraud has topped the table. The biggest slice of the 246,570 ID fraud cases reported - almost 30% - concerned abuses of people's credit. Misusing someone's identity to claim new credit cards or loans comprised 16.5% of the total, with almost 12% coming from false claims on existing credit. Another 18% came from attempts to rip off people's bank accounts, while 13% of cases concerned attempts to defraud employers by abusing someone else's identity. Outside the field of ID theft, 53% of the near-400,000 complaints were internet-related. Among the 100,000 internet auction complaints, the failure of sellers to deliver or the supply of sub-standard goods were the most common woes reported. Catalogue and home-shopping frauds were next in line, accounting for 8% of total complaints, while concerns about internet services and computers - including spyware found on people's PCs and undisclosed charges for websites - amounted to 6% of complaints.\\n\",\n",

Last April, Argentina signed a $240m agreement to import Venezuelan fuel in exchange for agricultural goods and this deal has now been extended. Venezuela will now import cattle, medicines and medical equipment. Last year, Argentina's severe energy crisis forced President Kirchner to suspend gas exports to Chile. Argentina fears that rising demand could spark another crisis and wants to prevent it by signing this deal. The two countries also formalised a co-operation deal between Venezuelan energy firm PDVSA and Argentina's Enarsa. Under this deal, the Argentine market will be opened to Venezuelan investment. President Chavez added that Brazil's Petrobras could join soon the co-operation deal. President Chavez is an ardent promoter of the concept of a South American oil company, which could include the state-owned companies of Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil and Bolivia. The two presidents also agreed to create 'Television Sur', a Latin American network of state-owned television channels.\\n\",\n",
       " 'BMW to recall faulty diesel cars\\n \\n BMW is to recall all cars equipped with a faulty diesel fuel-injection pump supplied by parts maker Robert Bosch.\\n \\n The faulty part does not represent a safety risk and the recall only affects pumps made in December and January. BMW said that it was too early to say how many cars were affected or how much the recall would cost. The German company is to extend a planned production break at one of its plants due to the faulty Bosch part. The Dingolfing site will now be closed all next week instead of for just two days. The additional three-day stoppage will mean a production loss of up to 3,600 vehicles, BMW said, adding that it was confident it could make up the numbers later.\\n \\n Bosch has stopped production of the part but expects to restart by 2 February. The faulty component does not represent a safety risk but causes the motor to stall after a significant amount of mileage. When asked if BMW would be seeking compensation from Bosch, the carmaker\\'s chief executive Helmut Panke said: \"we will first solve the problem before talking about who will pay\". Audi and Mercedes Benz were also supplied with the defective diesel fuel-injection pumps but neither of them have to recall any vehicles. A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, parent company of Mercedes Benz, said it will however have to halt some production. It is to close the Mercedes factory in Sindelfingen on Monday and Tuesday. Audi said it had been hit by production bottlenecks, due to a shortage of unaffected Bosch parts.\\n',\n",

Yet other names mentioned in connection to buying Exel are DHL-owner Deutsche Post and finance firm GE Capital. With its shares closing Tuesday at 873p, Bracknell-based Exel is currently valued at Â£2.6bn ($6.3bn).\\n \\n Exel employs 109,000 people in more than 120 countries and has itself been active in the consolidation of the logistics sector, paying Â£328m to buy fellow UK firm Tibbett & Britten last August. Its customers include Boots, Burberry, Mothercare and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble. Andrew Beh, of brokers ING, said UPS and Deutsche Post were the most likely bidders and an offer of 950p a share would be fair if a bidding battle did not break out. \"It\\'s a great strategic fit for both companies,\" he said. \"Both are interested in expanding in logistics and you can make a decent case for cost synergies which could justify the premium and that\\'s before you make any argument about revenue synergies.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Yukos accused of lying to court\\n \\n Russian oil firm Yukos lied to a US court in an attempt to stop the Russian government selling off its key production unit, the court has heard.\\n \\n The unit, Yugansk, was sold to pay off a $27.5bn (Â£14.5bn) back tax bill. Yukos argued that since it had a US subsidiary and local bank accounts, the US court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of Yugansk. But Deutsche Bank - itself a target of a Yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case.\\n \\n Deutsche Bank\\'s evidence came on the first day of a two-day hearing in Houston. Its lawyer, Hugh Ray, told the court that Yukos had claimed it had transferred $27m into two Texas bank accounts opened by its new US subsidiary. By doing so, he said, the firm had intended to reinforce its US presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in US courts. But he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after Yukos made its bankruptcy application on 14 December, and then backdated.\\n \\n Yukos chief financial officer Bruce Misamore, who had moved to the US in early December to set up Yukos USA, acknowledged the point. He said the discrepancy was only in the paperwork, but that money had indeed been transferred on 14 December. Even so, he told the court that only $480,000 had been in the accounts that day, with the rest arriving a day later.\\n \\n Deutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos. It had agreed to loan to an arm of Russian state gas firm Gazprom the money to bid for Yuganskneftegaz, as the Yukos unit is formally known. The sale went ahead, despite an order from the US bankruptcy court ordered that it should be stopped. In the end, the auction was won by an unknown shell company for $9.4bn - much less than most assessments of its value - before ending up in the hands of state-controlled oil firm Rosneft. Rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with Gazprom, bringing a large chunk of Russia\\'s very profitable oil business back under state control.\\n \\n Yukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the US because it feared it would not be able to do so in Russia. It also said that in the event of going bust, it could offer the chance of restructuring. \"It gives us a kind of life after death alternative,\" said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede. Yukos is currently suing four companies - Gazprom, its unit Gazpromneft, Rosneft and the shell company which won the bidding - for their part in Yugansk\\'s disposal. It has also threatened to sue the Russian government for $28bn. Analysts have questioned whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies, while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos\\' legal wrangling as meaningless. Yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, once Russia\\'s richest man, is in prison, having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.\\n',\n",

Better records and greater prosperity of Mexican expatriates in the US are the main reasons behind the increase. About 10 million Mexicans live in the US, where there are 16 million citizens of Mexican origin. Remittances now represent more than 2% of the country's GDP, according to the Bank of Mexico's figures. Last year, there were 50.9 million transactions, with an average value of $327 per remittance, the bank said. According to Standard & Poor's, which has recently upgraded Mexico's sovereign debt rating, the rise in remittances helps protect the Mexican economy against a potential fall in the international oil prices.\\n \\n The growth in remittances has sparked fierce competition between banks. Bank of America announced last week that it planned to eliminate transfer fees for some customers. Remittance charges are estimated to have dropped by between 50 and 60%, reports from the US Treasury and the Inter-American Development Bank have said. The Inter-American Development Bank estimates that remittances to Latin America and the Caribbean reached $45bn in 2004.\\n\",\n",

Mortgage lending rose by Â£7.1bn in December, up from a Â£6.4bn rise in November. The figures contradict a survey from the British Bankers\\' Association, which said approvals were at a five-year low.\\n \\n Analysts say the figures show the market may be stabilising but still point to further house price softness. \"The modest rise in mortgage approvals and lending in December reinforces the impression that the housing market is currently slowing steadily rather than sharply,\" said Global Insight analyst Howard Archer, commenting on the BoE\\'s figures. The BBA believes that the property market is continuing to cool down. Changes to mortgage regulation may have artificially depressed figures in November, thus flattering the December figures, analysts said. In October last year, new rules came into force, which meant some lenders were forced to withdraw mortgage products temporarily in November and defer some lending until they had made sure they had complied with the rules properly. Separately, the Bank of England said that consumer credit rose by Â£1.5bn in December, more than the Â£1.4bn expected and above the Â£1.4bn reported in the previous month.\\n',\n",

But, despite missing forecasts of 53.7, the PMI number remained above 50 - indicating expansion in the sector. The CIPS said that the strong pound had dented exports while rising oil and metals prices had kept costs high.\\n \\n The survey added that rising input prices and cooling demand had deterred factory managers from hiring new workers in an effort to cut costs. That triggered the second successive monthly fall in the CIPS employment index to 48.3 - its lowest level since June 2003. The survey is more upbeat than official figures - which suggest that manufacturing is in recession - but analysts said the survey did suggest that the manufacturing recovery was running out of steam. \"It appears that the UK is in a two-tier economy again,\" said Prebon Yamane economist Lena Komileva. \"You have weakness in manufacturing, which I think would concern policymakers at the Bank of England.\"\\n',\n",

The phone company collapsed in 2002 and prosecutors claim that losses were hidden to protect the firm\\'s shares. Mr Myers has already pleaded guilty to fraud and is assisting prosecutors.\\n \\n On Monday, defence lawyer Reid Weingarten tried to distance his client from the allegations. During cross examination, he asked Mr Myers if he ever knew Mr Ebbers \"make an accounting decision?\". \"Not that I am aware of,\" Mr Myers replied. \"Did you ever know Mr Ebbers to make an accounting entry into Worldcom books?\" Mr Weingarten pressed. \"No,\" replied the witness. Mr Myers has admitted that he ordered false accounting entries at the request of former Worldcom chief financial officer Scott Sullivan. Defence lawyers have been trying to paint Mr Sullivan, who has admitted fraud and will testify later in the trial, as the mastermind behind Worldcom\\'s accounting house of cards.\\n \\n Mr Ebbers\\' team, meanwhile, are looking to portray him as an affable boss, who by his own admission is more PE graduate than economist. Whatever his abilities, Mr Ebbers transformed Worldcom from a relative unknown into a $160bn telecoms giant and investor darling of the late 1990s. Worldcom\\'s problems mounted, however, as competition increased and the telecoms boom petered out. When the firm finally collapsed, shareholders lost about $180bn and 20,000 workers lost their jobs.

Profit growth in the insurance market has not matched expansion at Citigroup\\'s other businesses. For Metlife, the US\\'s leading insurance company, the purchase gives it access to a much larger distribution network.\\n \\n Robert Benmosche, Metlife\\'s chairman and chief executive, said that it was a \"great opportunity for the brand of Metlife to be distributed through Citigroup\". Under the agreement, Metlife will be able to sell its products through Citigroup over the next 10 years. The deal includes Smith Barney retail brokerages and Citibank branches. The company will pay between $1bn and $3bn in Metlife stock with the rest being made up of cash. Travelers had sales of $5.2bn in 2004 and made a profit of $901m. It has total net assets of $96bn. \"This deal employs some of Metlife\\'s excess capital in a potentially higher-return business and gives it more distribution,\" said Stuart Quint, an analyst at Gartmore.\\n',\n",
       " 'Europe blames US over weak dollar\\n \\n European leaders have openly blamed the US for the sharp rise in the value of the euro.\\n \\n US officials were talking up the dollar, they said, but failing to take action to back up their words. Meeting in Brussels, finance ministers of the 12 eurozone countries voiced their concern that the rise of the european currency was harming exports. The dollar is within touching distance of an all-time low reached earlier in November. At 0619 GMT on Tuesday, the dollar was up slightly at just above $1.29 to the euro, and buying 105.6 yen in Tokyo. It rallied briefly on Monday amid signs that oil prices are easing.\\n \\n But analysts said the respite was likely to be only temporary. The European ministers\\' comments, said Junya Tanase of JPMorgan Chase bank in Tokyo, were \"generally too weak to produce a market reaction\".\\n \\n Still, by the standards of diplomacy the European ministers were forthright. Nicolas Sarkozy of France said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit Europe\\'s economies by eating into their exports. \"We are concerned about these developments, which are destabilising, and which are linked to the accumulation of deficits by our American friends,\" he said. The comments come a day after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was \"in America\\'s interest\".\\n \\n But that was not enough for Mr Sarkozy.\\n \\n \"If the Americans were to change their policy, it\\'s up to them to say so,\" he said. And the European Union\\'s monetary affairs commissioner, made it clear that action was necessary. \"I fully welcome the words of Mr Snow,\" said Joaquin Almunia, \"but we will need to see decisions adopted in that direction. \"If the imbalances in the US economy are not adjusted in the future, the decision in the market will be as in the past weeks.\" Economists point out that whatever Europe says, in the short term a weaker dollar is a boon to President George W Bush\\'s administration. Not only does it boost US exports, but it also makes the budget deficit easier to fund. On the other hand, slower European exports would mean slower EU growth - potentially reducing the demand for US goods.\\n',\n",
       " 'French wine gets 70m euro top-up\\n \\n The French government is to hand its struggling wine industry 70m euros ($91m) in aid to help it battle falling sales and damaging overproduction.\\n \\n The financial package is aimed at assisting vintners in financial trouble and improving how its wine is marketed. The French wine industry, the world\\'s second largest, has been hit by declining consumption at home and the growing popularity of New World wines. Wine makers, however, claimed the support did not go far enough. The package was announced by agriculture minister Dominique Bussereau after talks with vintners\\' representatives.\\n \\n The bulk of the money - about 40m euros - will be offered in the form of preferential loans to heavily indebted producers to enable them to reschedule their payments. A further 15m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives, which make up the majority of French producers, in low interest loans. Efforts to promote French wine abroad are to be boosted by an extra 3.5m euros in funding. France fell behind the \\'New World\\' producers of Australia, Chile and the United States for the first time in 2003 in terms of exports.\\n \\n Domestic consumption, accounting for 70% of sales, has suffered from strict restrictions on advertising and tough drink-driving laws.\\n \\n The aid package would \"create a positive climate around French viticulture,\" Mr Bussereau said. However, wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for. \"I am afraid the resources are not up to the ambitions,\" Jean-Michel Lemetayer, from the FNSEA agricultural union, told the Associated Press news agency. In an effort to tackle overcapacity, the government will agree that vines can be destroyed in areas where growers give their unanimous consent, while 500 vintners will be helped to take early retirement. The government will also seek European Union approval to distil about 250 million litres of excess wine into alcohol, with vintners receiving compensation. Production is currently outstripping demand by about 30%. The support is designed to make French producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across the wine industry. Wine makers in France\\'s best-known regions, such as Burgundy, have found it hard to invest in new technology and to create recognisable brands to appeal to overseas buyers.\\n',\n",

Russia\\'s reputation among investors has been hurt in recent months by the heavy tax bills and asset seizures imposed on companies such as oil giant Yukos. S&P said the solidity of government finances outweighed the risk. Russia is now a net creditor rather than a debtor. Gold and foreign currency reserves of $119bn beat its foreign public debt of some $113bn.\\n \\n The other two major ratings agencies - Fitch and Moody\\'s have long since upped their rating of Russia\\'s sovereign debt. S&P had held back through fear that the government was dragging its feet on economic and legal reforms. Now, though, it has finally followed suit. But the agency made it clear that the improved rating did not mean that the risks were a thing of the past. Instead, with Russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales, S&P said the government\\'s own debt is looking a good bet. \"These improvements are so significant that they now outweight the serious and growing political risk that continues to be a key ratings constraint on Russia,\" wrote S&P credit analyst Helena Hessel.\\n \\n The Yukos saga is the most high-profile of the political risks to which Ms Hessel alludes. The company\\'s founder and ex-chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, is in jail on trial for tax evasion and fraud. Many believe the real motive for his prosecution is that he threatened to use his wealth to set up a political alternative to President Vladimir Putin. His company, meanwhile, is widely believed to have fallen victim to the Kremlin\\'s wish to get Russian energy resources as far as possible back under state control.\\n',\n",

They have already given themselves a veto over all foreign investment deals, following allegations about Turkish firms\\' involvement in Israel. Turkcell now says it may give up on the deal altogether.\\n \\n Iran currently has only one heavily congested mobile network, with long waiting lists for new subscribers. Turkcell signed a contract for the new network in September. The new operator planned to offer subscriptions for about $180, well below the existing firm\\'s $500 price tag. But a parliamentary commission has now ruled that Turkcell\\'s 70% controlling stake is too high. They say that Turkcell is a security risk because of alleged business ties with Israel. Parliament as a whole - dominated by religious conservatives - will vote on the ruling on Tuesday.\\n \\n Turkcell said the ruling would \"make more difficult... Turkcell\\'s financial consolidation of Irancell\" because its stake would be reduced to less than 50%. \"If management control and financial consolidation of Irancell cannot be achieved... the realisation of the project will become risky,\" it warned in a statement. The firm has refused to comment on whether it has business dealings in Israel, although like almost all GSM operators worldwide it has an interconnection deal with Israeli networks so that its customers can use their phones there. The two countries strengthened ties in both defence and economic issues in 2004. Israeli industry minister Ehud Olmert was reported in June to have attended a meeting between Ruhi Dogusoy, Turkcell\\'s chief operating officer, and executives from Israeli telecoms firms. Telecoms is one of two areas specifically targeted by the new veto law on foreign investments, passed earlier in September. The other is airports, a source of controversy after the army closed Tehran\\'s new Imam Khomeini International Airport on its opening day in May 2004. Again, the allegation was that the part-Turkish TAV consortium which built and ran it had links with Israel.\\n',\n",
       " 'Argentina closes $102.6bn debt swap\\n \\n Argentina is set to close its $102.6bn (Â£53.51bn) debt restructuring offer for bondholders later on Friday, with the government hopeful that most creditors will accept the deal.\\n \\n The estimated loss to bondholders is up to 70% of the original value of the bonds, yet the majority are expected to accept the government\\'s offer. Argentina defaulted on its debt three years ago, the biggest sovereign default in modern history. Yesterday Argentina\\'s economy minister, Roberto Lavagna, said that he estimated that the results of the restructuring would be ready around next Thursday (3 March). Argentina\\'s President, Nestor Kirchner, said on Friday: \"A year ago when we started the swap (negotiations), they told us we were crazy, that we were irrational.\" But he added that his government was close to achieving: \"The best debt renegotiation in history.\" The country has been in default on the $102.6bn - based on an original debt of $81.8bn plus interest - for the past three years. If the offer does not go ahead, international lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved investors could follow but analysts are optimistic that it will go through, despite the tough terms for bondholders. About 70% to 80% of bondholders are expected to accept the terms of the offer. By 18 February, creditors holding $41bn - or 40% of the total debt - had accepted the offer. Sorting out its debt would enhance the country\\'s credibility on international markets and enable it to attract more foreign investment. Of Argentina\\'s bondholders, 38.4% reside in Argentina, 15.6% in Italy, 10.3% in Switzerland, 9.1% in the United States, 5.1% in Germany and 3.1% in Japan. Investors in the UK, Holland and Luxembourg have about 1% each and the remainder were not broken down by country. The deal is likely to be taken up most enthusiastically by domestic investors, who will benefit if Argentina\\'s economy becomes more stable.\\n',\n",

The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\\n \\n The new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast. In the final quarter of 2004, businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18%, up from 17.5% in the third quarter. Consumer spending grew 4.2% in the final quarter, down from the third quarter's 5.1%.\\n\",\n",

Dr Reddy's has built its reputation on producing generic versions of big-name pharmaceutical products. But competition has intensified and the firm and the company is short on new product launches. The most recent was the annoucement in December 2000 that it had won exclusive marketing rights for a generic version of the famous anti-depressant Prozac from its maker, Eli Lilly. It also lost a key court case in March 2004, banning it from selling a version of Pfizer's popular hypertension drug Norvasc in the US. Research and development of new drugs is continuing apace, with R&D spending rising 37% to 705m rupees - a key cause of the decrease in profits alongside the fall in sales. Patents on a number of well-known products are due to run out in the near future, representing an opportunity for Dr Reddy, whose shares are listed in New York, and other Indian generics manufacturers.\\n \\n Sales in Dr Reddy's generics business fell 8.6% to 966m rupees. Another staple of the the firm's business, the sale of ingredients for drugs, also performed poorly.

They also pointed out that positive comments apart, President George W Bush\\'s administration had done little to stop the dollar\\'s slide. A weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. The dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100GMT, still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 November. Against the Japanese yen, it was trading at 105.28 yen, after hitting a seven-month low of 105.17 earlier in the day.\\n \\n Policy makers in Europe have called the dollar\\'s slide \"brutal\" and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. However, it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro\\'s rise at a monthly meeting of Eurozone ministers late on Monday. Higher growth in Europe is regarded by US officials as a way the huge US current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. Mr Snow who is currently in Dublin at the start of a four-nation EU visit, has applauded Ireland\\'s introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth. \"The eurozone is growing below its potential. When a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners,\" he said. Mr Snow\\'s comments may have helped shore up the dollar on Monday, but he was careful to qualify his statement.\\n \\n \"Our basic policy, of course, is to let open, competitive markets set the values,\" he explained. \"Markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals.\" US officials have also said that other economies need to grow, so the US is not the main global growth engine. Economists say that the fundamentals, or key indicators, of the US economy are looking far from rosy. Domestic consumer demand is cooling, and heavy spending by President Bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $427bn (Â£230bn). The current account deficit, meanwhile, hit a record $166bn in the second quarter of 2004. For many analysts, a weaker dollar is here to stay. \"No end is in sight,\" said Carsten Fritsch, a strategist at Commerzbank . \"It is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $1.30.\" Some analysts maintain the US is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in Europe, thus boosting its economy.\\n',\n",

Meanwhile, Asian carmakers fared well - Toyota sales jumped 11% while rival Nissan notched up a 10% increase. Overall. sales across the industry also fell to 1.25 million vehicles from 1.27 million a year earlier.\\n \\n GM and Ford blamed high fuel prices for low sales of big trucks and gas-guzzling sports utility vehicles (SUVs) - the vehicles that provide the biggest profits.\\n \\n GM added that US truck sales fell 9% in February while car business tumbled 17%, however it did acknowledge that some new products - such as the Pontiac G6 and Chevrolet Cobalt - had put in solid performances. \"The calendar year is starting off slower than expected, both for GM and the industry,\" said Mark LaNeve, GM\\'s vice president for North American sales, service and marketing. The slump in sales prompted the group to cut production in North America by 3% - it has already reduced output by around 9% in the face of growing stockpiles. Meanwhile, Ford which posted its ninth consecutive drop in monthly US sales, said it was cutting first-quarter North American production by another 10,000 vehicles, or 1.2%. Chrysler, the US unit of Germany\\'s DaimlerChrysler, was the only Detroit based automaker to boast an increase in market share during the month - with sales rising 8%.\\n \\n But America\\'s loss was its foreign rivals\\' gain as they continued to nibble away at the US market. While Japan\\'s top car maker Toyota and Nissan saw sales accelerate, even the smaller Suzuki Motor Corp snapped up a more business with sales improving 17.6% on a year ago. In 2003, the firm launched an ambitious plan to triple US sales by 2007 as it seeks to become a bigger player in the Asian assault on the US market. Korea\\'s Hyundai was another big gainer, turning in a 19% surge in February sales. Toyota put its rise in sales down to strong results for its redesigned Avalon sedan and a 120% surge in sales of its gas-electric Prius hybrid mid-size sedan as petrol-price conscious consumers looked to vehicles that were cheaper to run. \"As gas prices continue their upward march, fuel efficiency catches the public eye,\" Jim Press, vice president and chief operating officer of Toyota\\'s US sales arm, said in a statement.\\n',\n",

The prosecution\\'s star witness is Mr Sullivan, one of six WorldCom executives indicted in the case, He has pleaded guilty to fraud and appeared as a prosecution witness as part of an agreement with prosecutors. During his time on the witness stand Mr Sullivan repeatedly told jurors he met frequently with Mr Ebbers, told him about changes made to WorldCom\\'s accounts to hide costs and had warned him such practises were improper.

However, shortly after the Bank made its decision, new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter. The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts.\\n \\n The rate hike was the first since December 2003 and had been well-flagged in advance. However, opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis.\\n \\n The figures, representing a decline from the 0.2% growth in GDP seen between July and September, were below market expectations. Consumer spending remains strong, however, and the Bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures. \"Over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited,\" said Ian Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank.\\n \\n At 2.6%, inflation remains within the Bank\\'s 2-3% target range. However, exports declined in the second half of 2004, fuelling a rise in the country\\'s current account deficit - the difference in the value of imports compared to exports - to a record Australian dollar 29.4bn. The Australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low. \"The economy has been strong and it is properly moderating but it doesn\\'t look to me like it\\'s slowing in any unreasonable way,\" said Treasurer Peter Costello.

At the time, Titan was trying to get a higher price for a telecommunications project in Benin. There is no suggestion that Mr Kerekou was himself aware of any wrongdoing. Titan, a California-based company, pleaded guilty to falsifying its accounts and violating US anti-bribery laws. It agreed to pay $13m in criminal penalties, as well as $15.5m to settle a civil lawsuit brought by the US financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\\n \\n The SEC had accused Titan of illegally paying $2.1m to an unnamed agent in Benin claiming ties with President Kerekou. Some of the money was used to pay for T-shirts with campaign slogans on them ahead of the 2001 election. Shortly after the poll, which Mr Kerekou won, Benin officials agreed to quadruple Titan\\'s management fee.

Marsh posted a $676m (Â£352m) loss for the last three months of 2004, against a $375m (Â£195.3m) profit a year before. It blamed an $850m payout to settle a price-rigging lawsuit, brought by New York attorney general Elliot Spitzer. Under the settlement announced in January, Marsh took a pre-tax charge of $618m in the October-to-December quarter, on top of the $232m charge from the previous quarter. \"Clearly 2004 was the most difficult year in MMC\\'s financial history,\" Marsh chief executive Michael Cherkasky said.\\n \\n An ongoing restructuring drive at the group also led to a $337m hit in the fourth quarter, the world\\'s biggest insurer said.\\n \\n Analysts expect its latest round of cuts to focus on its brokerage unit, which employs 40,000 staff. The latest layoffs will take the total number of jobs to go at the firm to 5,500 and are expected to lead to annual savings of more than $375m. As part of its efforts to cut costs, the company said it was halving its dividend payment to 17 cents a shares from 34 cents, a move which should enable it to save $360m. Looking ahead, Mr Cherkasky forecast profitable growth for the year ahead \"with an operating margin in the upper-teens, and with the opportunity for further margin expansion\". Meanwhile, the company also announced it would spin-off its MMC Capital private equity unit, which manages the $3bn Trident Funds operation, to a group of employees. Marsh did not say when the move would take place, but said it had signed a letter of intent.\\n \\n The insurer hit the headlines in October last year when it faced accusations of price rigging. New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer sued the company, accusing it of receiving illegal payments to steer clients to selected firms as well as rigging bids and fixing prices. In January, Marsh agreed to pay $850m to settle the suit - a figure in line with the placement fees it collected in 2003 - and agreed to change its business practices. In February, a former senior executive pleaded guilty to criminal charges in a wide-ranging probe of fraud and bid-rigging in the insurance industry. In January, a former senior vice president also pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to the investigation. In an effort to reform its business practises, Marsh said it has already introduced new leadership, new compliance procedures and new ways of dealing with customers. \"As a result, we are ready to put these matters behind us and move ahead in 2005 to restore the trust our clients have placed in us and to rebuild shareholder value,\" Mr Cherkasky said.\\n',\n",

Government lawyers said they would ask the full US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to hear the case. The court room battle is seen as key in government attempts to fight smoking. \"It\\'s pretty clear that they\\'ve suffered a severe setback,\" said Anthony Sebok, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, adding that the appeal was what the government \"would be expected to ask for\".\\n \\n Prosecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking, ignored research that highlighted problems, looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts. Among the firms accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. Prosecutors went after the companies using legislation put in place to fight organised crime, and accused the firms of conspiring and running \"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations\". The tobacco companies denied the charges, saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public. They also said that they have met many of the government\\'s demands laid out in a landmark $206bn settlement hammered out in 1998 with 46 states. A three-judge panel agreed with the companies, finding that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws.\\n \\n Central to the government\\'s case was a meeting in the Plaza Hotel, New York, on 15 December, 1953. Prosecutors contend that executives from the major tobacco firms met and agreed to present a unified strategy denying the harmful effects of smoking. Despite denying for decades that smoking could be linked to illness, the companies have modified their stances in recent years. Altria\\'s Philip Morris now accepts that nicotine is harmful, and the company\\'s main lawyer William Ohlemeyer told the BBC last year that earlier statements may have been wrong but they were not dishonest.

Aston - whose cars were famously used by James Bond - will unveil the Vantage at the Geneva Motor Show on Thursday. Mr Bez - himself a former executive at rival Porsche - said the new car was the company\\'s \"most affordable car ever and makes the brand accessible\". This in turn would make Aston Martin \"globally visible, but still very, very exclusive\", he added.\\n \\n First shown as a concept car at the 2003 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, the V8 Vantage will be available in the UK in late summer. Development costs for the Vantage have been kept low by sharing a platform with Aston\\'s DB9, which Mr Bez described as \"the previous most important car for our company\". There is currently an 18 months waiting list for the DB9, Mr Bez said. The Vantage will be built at the new Aston factory in Gaydon, near Warwick, and should more than double Aston\\'s total output from about 2,000 presently.\\n',\n",

He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules. Any rate rise ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party\\'s chances of winning, he added. Last July, Mr Balls won the right to step down from his Treasury position and run for parliament, defending the Labour stronghold of Normanton in West Yorkshire.\\n \\n Mr Balls rejected the allegation that Mr Brown had been sidelined in the election campaign, saying he was playing a \"different\" role to the one he played in the last two elections. He rejected speculation that Mr Brown was considering becoming Foreign Secretary, saying his recent travels had been linked to efforts to boost international development. Gordon Brown\\'s decision to announce the date of the Budget while on a trip to China was a \"sensible thing to do\", since he was talking about skills and investment at the time, Mr Balls told the BBC. Commenting on speculation of an interest rate rise, he said it was not within the remit of the Bank of England\\'s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to factor a potential election into its rate decisions. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed that house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"I don\\'t believe it would be a big election issue in Britain or a problem for Labour,\" Mr Balls said. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May as the likely day.\\n',\n",

The IMF said that, according to data provided by the Liberians, the country\\'s GDP rose by 2% in 2004, after a 31% decline in 2003. Liberia is recovering from a 14-year civil war that came to an end in 2003. The power-sharing National Transition Government of Liberia will remain in place until elections on 11 October, the first presidential and parliamentary ballots since the conflict ended.\\n \\n The IMF said Liberia\\'s economy started to grow last year thanks to a \"continued strong recovery in rubber production, domestic manufacturing and local services including post-conflict reconstruction\". The IMF however remains cautious about what it sees as a lack of transparency in government actions. In particular, it pointed to mystery surrounding the sale of iron ore stockpiles and the alleged disappearance of some import and export permits. These matters are now being investigated by the Liberian authorities and the IMF has called for their findings to be made public. The IMF also said it was crucial that the Central Bank of Liberia be strengthened, the national budget be effectively managed and a sound economic basis built to allow the country\\'s large external debt to be addressed. \"The IMF team stands ready to assist the (Liberian) authorities in strengthening the areas mentioned,\" said the report. \"The team agreed with the (Liberian) authorities that the period until elections and the inauguration of a new government will pose exceptional challenges to fiscal management, and expresses its willingness to provide...continued support.\"\\n',\n",

Although the index was lower than in January, the fact that it held above 50 shows continued growth in the sector. \"February was another good month in the manufacturing sector,\" said ISM survey chairman Norbert Ore.\\n \\n \"While the overall rate of growth is slowing, the overall picture is improving as price increases and shortages are becoming less of a problem. Exports and imports remain strong,\" he said. Analysts had expected February\\'s figure to be stronger than January\\'s and come in at 57.

Operating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003. Lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus. It was also hit by troubles at its US catering business. Last year, Lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share. In 2003, shareholders did not get a dividend. The company said that it will give all the details of its 2004 results on 23 March.\\n',\n",

Exports - the usual engine of recovery - faltered, while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short. The growth falls well short of expectations, but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion.\\n \\n The economy had stagnated throughout the 1990s, experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums. One result was deflation - prices falling rather than rising - which made Japanese shoppers cautious and kept them from spending.\\n \\n The effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery. But high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the growth rate, while the falling dollar means products shipped to the US are becoming relatively more expensive.\\n \\n The performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year. The first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%, with the second showing 1.1%, and economists had been predicting as much as 2% this time around. \"Exports slowed while capital spending became weaker,\" said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo. \"Personal consumption looks good, but it was mainly due to temporary factors such as the Olympics. \"The amber light is flashing.\" The government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes, a policy it will have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with Japan\\'s massive public debt.\\n',\n",

The company also cited difficult trading conditions and a lack of demand for goods such as its Slimfast range. Unilever, which owns brands including Dove soap, said annual pre-tax profit fell 36% to 2.9bn euros (Â£1.99bn). Shares fell 1% to 510.75 pence in London, and dropped by 1.2% to 50.50 euros in Amsterdam.\\n \\n Under the restructuring plans, Patrick Cescau, the UK-based co-chairman, will become group chief executive. Dutch co-chairman Antony Burgmans will take on the role of non-executive chairman.\\n \\n \"We have recognised the need for greater clarity of leadership and we are moving to a simpler leadership structure that will provide a sharper operational focus,\" Mr Burgmans said. \"We are leaving behind one of the key features of Unilever\\'s governance but this is a natural development following the changes introduced last year.\" The company, which has had dual headquarters in Rotterdam and London since 1930, will announce the location of its head office at a later date. Unilever is not alone in trying to simplify its business. Oil giant Shell last year dismantled its dual-ownership structure, after a series of problems relating to the size of its oil reserves that hammered its share price and led to the resignation of key board members. \"The best part of the news this morning was that the company announced a structure simplification,\" said Arjan Sweere, an analyst at Petercam.\\n \\n The company said the organizational changes would speed decision making, and it also may make further changes.\\n \\n The company said its main focus will be on improving profits, and it is planning to accelerate and increase investment in its 400 main brands. \"While it is certainly the case that markets have been tougher in the past eighteen months than we had expected, we have also lost some market share,\" said Mr Cescau. \"We let a range of targets limit our ability flexibility and did not adjust our plans quickly enough to a more difficult business environment.\" \"Our objective is to reverse the share loss that we experienced in some markets in 2004 and return to growth.\"\\n \\n Unilever said European sales fell 2.8% last year, dragged down by below part sales at its beverage division, where revenues dipped by almost 4%.\\n \\n Sales of ice cream and frozen food dipped by 3.4% In the US last year, revenue grew by 1.5% \"despite disappointing sales in Slimfast\", the company said. In Asia, leading products came under \"attack\" from rivals such as Procter & Gamble. Unilever took a 1.5bn euro one-time charge in the fourth quarter, including a 650m euro write-down on Slimfast diet foods. Sales of Slimfast products have been hit in recent years by the popularity of the Atkins diet. But looking ahead, Unilever said it was optimistic about prospects for its slimming products saying that demand is on the wane for rival low-carbohydrate diets. The company also said it planned to spend 500m euros this year buying back shares.\\n',\n",

Increased take-up of broadband telecoms services also boosted France Telecom\\'s profits, which showed a 5.5% rise to 18.3bn euros ($23.4bn; Â£12.5bn). France Telecom is to spend 578m euros on buying out minority shareholders in data services provider Equant.\\n \\n France Telecom, one of the world\\'s largest telecoms and internet service providers, saw its full-year sales rise 2.2% to 47.2bn euros in 2004.\\n \\n Orange enjoyed strong growth outside France and the United Kingdom - its core markets - swelling its subscriber base to 5.4 million. France Telecom\\'s broadband customers also increased, rising to 5.1 million across Europe by the end of the year. The firm said it had met its main strategic objectives of growing its individual businesses and further reducing its large debt. An ill-fated expansion drive in the late 1990s saw France Telecom\\'s debt soar to 72bn euros by 2002. However, this has now been reduced to 43.9bn euros. \"Our results for 2004 allow us to improve our financial structure while focusing on the innovation that drives our strategy,\" said chief executive Thierry Breton.\\n \\n Looking ahead, the company forecast like-for-like sales growth of between 3% and 5% over the next three years. France Telecom is consolidating its interest in Equant, which provides telecoms and data services to businesses.

It is the second time Vodafone has come under the Commission\\'s scrutiny. The UK operator is already appealing against allegations that its UK roaming rates are \"unfair and excessive\". Vodafone\\'s response to the Commission\\'s letter was defiant. \"We believe the roaming market is competitive and we expect to resist the charges,\" said a Vodafone spokesman. \"However we will need time to examine the statement of objections in detail before we formally respond.\"\\n \\n The Commission\\'s investigation into Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom\\'s T-Mobile centres on the tariffs the two companies charge foreign mobile operators to access their networks when subscribers of those foreign operators use their mobile phones in Germany.\\n \\n The Commission believes these wholesale prices are too high and that the excess is passed on to consumers. \"The Commission aims to ensure that European consumers are not overcharged when they use their mobile phones on their travels around the European Union,\" the Commission said in a statement. Vodafone and O2, Britain\\'s other big mobile phone operator, were sent similar statements of objections by the Commission in July last year. Vodafone sent the Commission a response to those allegations in December last year and is now waiting for a reply. The Vodafone spokesman said a similar process would be set in motion with these latest statement of objections about its operations in Germany.\\n \\n The companies will have three months to respond to the Commission\\'s allegations and the process \"may go on for some time yet\", the spokesman said. The Commission could charge the companies up to 10% of their annual turnover, though in practice that sort of figure is rarely demanded. The Commission\\'s latest move comes just a few months after national telecoms regulators across Europe launched a joint investigation which could lead to people being charged less for using their mobile phone when travelling abroad. The investigation involves regulators assessing whether there is effective competition in the roaming market.\\n',\n",

Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom\\'s collapse in 2002. He pleads not guilty. The firm had been overstating its accounts by $11bn (Â£8.5bn). Mr Sullivan, 42, has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following Mr Ebbers\\' trial, where he is appearing as a prosecution witness. Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom\\'s finances.\\n \\n In the New York court on Wednesday, Mr Ebbers\\' lawyer Reid Weingarten asked Mr Sullivan: \"If you believe something is in your interest, you are willing and able to lie to accomplish it, isn\\'t that right?\"\\n \\n \"On that date, yes. I was lying,\" replied Mr Sullivan. Mr Weingarten has suggested that Mr Sullivan is implicating Mr Ebbers only to win a lighter sentence, something Mr Sullivan denies. Mr Sullivan also rejects a suggestion that he had once told fellow WorldCom board member Bert Roberts that Mr Ebbers was unaware of the accounting fraud at WorldCom. The trial of Mr Ebbers is now into its third week.\\n \\n Under 23 hours of questioning from a federal prosecutor, Mr Sullivan has previously told the court that he repeatedly warned Mr Ebbers that falsifying the books would be the only way to meet Wall Street revenue and earnings expectations. Mr Sullivan claims that Mr Ebbers refused to stop the fraud. Mr Ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. WorldCom\\'s problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies. Prosecutors allege that the company\\'s top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period. WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as MCI.\\n',\n",

Mercedes-Benz\\'s woes - its profits slid to just 20m euros - obscured a strong performance from the Chrysler group whose returns met market expectations. Mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from BMW and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006.\\n \\n Mercedes\\' profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003\\'s 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros. For the year as a whole, its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros. Sales of Mercedes\\' brands fell 2% as demand cooled, while revenues were affected by the weakness of the US dollar.\\n \\n The carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its Mercedes Smart mini-car range. Mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros, having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with German workers last year. The firm said it was determined to retain Mercedes\\' position as the world\\'s most successful luxury brand. However, DaimlerChrysler\\'s shares fell 1.5% on the news. \"While all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround Mercedes-Benz,\" Michael Rabb, an analyst with Bank Sal Oppenheim, told Reuters.\\n \\n In contrast, Chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues - calculated in US dollars - rose 10%. The US division - whose marques include Dodge and Jeep - transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1.4bn euros profit last year.\\n \\n Overall, DaimlerChrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4.7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros. Chrysler\\'s strong performance helped the world\\'s fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros.\\n \\n \"The year 2004 shows that our strategy works well - even in such a challenging competitive environment,\" said Jurgen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler\\'s chairman. DaimlerChrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture, Japanese subsidiary Fuso. DaimlerChrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner Mitsubishi Motors which will see it buy out its stake in Fuso. Looking forward, DaimerChrysler\\'s profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005.

Shares tumbled, however, as the company reported a profit margin of 45.6%, less than the 47.3% forecast by analysts and down from 47.1% in the third quarter. Ericsson shares dropped 5.9% to 20.7 kronor in early trading on Thursday. However, the company remained optimistic about its earnings outlook after sales in the fourth quarter rose 9% to 39.4bn kronor. \"Long-term growth drivers of the industry remain solid,\" Ericsson said in a statement.\\n \\n Chief executive Carl-Henric Svanberg explained that about \"27% of the world\\'s population now has access to mobile communications\". \"This is exciting for a company with a vision of an all-communicating world,\" he added. Mr Svanberg, however, warned that the extra demand that had driven 2004 sales had already dissipated and it was \"business as usual\". He added that sales in the first three months of 2005 would be subject to \"normal seasonality\".

But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month\\'s economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week\\'s inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\\n \\n Slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\\n \\n And recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\\n \\n Business groups welcomed the MPC\\'s widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Nigeria to boost cocoa production\\n \\n The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.\\n \\n Agriculture Minister Adamu Bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; Â£591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. Nigeria is currently the world\\'s fourth-largest cocoa producer.\\n \\n Cocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. \"People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,\" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. \"The farmers in the village never see any assistance,\" he added.\\n \\n At the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world\\'s second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world\\'s leading cocoa grower.\\n',\n",
       " 'US interest rates increased to 2%\\n \\n US interest rates are to rise for the fourth time in five months, in a widely anticipated move.\\n \\n The Federal Reserve has raised its key federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 2% in light of mounting evidence that the US economy is regaining steam. US companies created twice as many jobs as expected in October while exports hit record levels in September. Analysts said a clear-cut victory for President Bush in last week\\'s election paved the way for a rise. Another rise could be in store for December, some economists warned.\\n \\n The Fed\\'s Open Market Committee - which sets interest rate policy in the US - voted unanimously in favour of a quarter point rise. The Fed has been gradually easing rates up since the summer, with quarter percentage point rises in June, August and September.\\n \\n The Central Bank has been acting to restrain inflationary pressures while being careful not to obstruct economic growth. The Fed did not rule out raising rates once again in December but noted that any future increases would take place at a \"measured\" pace. In a statement, the Fed said that long-term inflation pressures remained \"well contained\" while the US economy appeared to be \"growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices\". Financial analysts broadly welcomed the Fed\\'s move and shares traded largely flat. The Dow Jones Industrial average closed down 0.89 points, or 0.01%, at 10,385.48.\\n \\n Recent evidence has pointed to an upturn in the US economy. US firms created 337,000 jobs last month, twice the amount expected, while exports reached record levels in September. The economy grew 3.7% in the third quarter, slower than forecast, but an improvement on the 3.3% growth seen in the second quarter. Analysts claimed the Fed\\'s assessment of future economic growth was a positive one but stressed that the jury was still out on the prospect of a further rise in December.\\n \\n \"Let\\'s wait until we see how growth and employment bear up under the fourth quarter\\'s energy price drag before concluding that the Fed has more work to do in 2005,\" said Avery Shenfeld, senior economist at CIBC World Markets.\\n \\n \"I think the Federal Reserve does not want to rock the boat and is using a gradual approach in raising the interest rate,\" said Sung Won Sohn, chief US economist for Wells Fargo Bank. \"The economy is doing a bit better right now but there are still some concerns about geopolitics, employment and the price of oil,\" he added. The further rise in US rates is unlikely to have a direct bearing on UK monetary policy. The Bank of England (BoE) has kept interest rates on hold at 4.75% for the past three months, leading some commentators to argue that rates may have peaked. In a report published on Wednesday, the Bank said that with rates at their current level, inflation would rise to its 2% target within two years. However, BoE governor Mervyn King warned only last month that the era of consistently low inflation and low unemployment may be coming to an end.\\n',\n",

The SEC also said it had brought fraud charges against two ex-senior executives of Columbia Distributor. Columbia Distributor was part of FleetBoston, bought by BOA last year. Three other ex-Columbia executives agreed settlements with the SEC.\\n \\n The SEC has set itself the task of stamping out the mutual funds\\' use of market-timing, a form of quick-fire, short-term share trading that harms the interests of small investors, with whom mutual funds are particularly popular. In the last two years, it has imposed penalties totalling nearly $2bn on 15 funds. The SEC unveiled two separate settlements, one covering BOA\\'s direct subsidiaries, and another for businesses that were part of FleetBoston at the time. In both cases, it said there had been secret deals to engage in market timing in mutual fund shares. The SEC agreed a deal totalling $375m with Banc of America Capital Management, BACAP Distributors and Banc of America Securities. It was made up of $250m to pay back gains from market timing, and $125m in penalties. It is to be paid to the damaged funds and their shareholders. Separately, the SEC said it had reached a $140m deal - equally split between penalties and compensation - in its probe into Columbia Management Advisors (CAM) and Columbia Funds Distributor (CFD) and three ex-Columbia executives. These businesses became part of BOA when it snapped up rival bank FleetBoston in a $47bn merger last March.\\n \\n The SEC filed civil fraud charges in a Boston Federal court against James Tambone, who it says headed CFD\\'s sales operations, and his alleged second in command Robert Hussey. The SEC is pressing for the highest tier of financial penalties against the pair for \"multiple violations\", repayment of any personal gains, and an injunction to prevent future breaches, a spokeswoman for the SEC\\'s Boston office told the BBC. There was no immediate comment from the men\\'s\\' lawyers. The SEC\\'s settlement with CAM and CFD included agreements with three other ex-managers, Peter Martin, Erik Gustafson and Joseph Palombo, who paid personal financial penalties of between $50-100,000.\\n',\n",
       " 'Train strike grips Buenos Aires\\n \\n A strike on the Buenos Aires underground has caused traffic chaos and large queues at bus stops in the Argentine capital.\\n \\n Tube workers walked out last week demanding a 53% pay rise and in protest against the installation of automatic ticket machines. Metrovias, the private firm which runs the five tube lines in the city, has offered an 8% increase in wages. The firm promised no jobs would be lost as a result of new ticket machines. It said it would put this commitment on paper.\\n \\n Underground staff have warned they will continue with the protests until the management put an acceptable offer on the table. The Argentine Work Ministry has been mediating in the conflict and it could call an \"obligatory conciliation\", which would force both sides to find a solution and put an end to the conflict. Some tube commuters have not hidden their frustration at the ongoing strike and have broken the windows of the underground trains, according to the local press. \"We are taken as hostages. I don\\'t know who is right, but the harm ones are us,\" said accountant Jose Lopez.\\n',\n",

The firm, a market leader in high-speed internet, had an operating loss for the three months to December of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; Â£38.4m). But without the Otoku marketing spend it would have made a profit - and expects to move into the black in 2006. The firm did not give a figure for the extent of profits it expected to make next year. It was born in the 1990s tech boom, investing widely and becoming a fast-rising star, till the end of the tech bubble hit it hard. Its recent return to a high profile came with the purchase of Japan Telecom, the country\\'s third-biggest fixed-line telecoms firm. The acquisition spurred its broadband internet division to pole position in the Japanese market, with more than 5.1 million subscribers at the end of December.\\n',\n",

It is currently arguing against an offer from Swiss Xstrata, which the firm raised to A$8.4bn last week after WMC said it was an undervaluation. Now reports say that the Australian government is against the deal.\\n \\n Trade Minister Mark Vaile has said that the bid may be \"against the national interest\". Mr Vaile, who was quoted in the Australian Financial Review, compared Xstrata\\'s attempt to take over WMC to a similar bid by oil giant Shell for Australia\\'s Woodside Petroleum in 2001. The bid was thrown out by Treasurer Peter Costello on national interest grounds. WMC\\'s interests in uranium deposits were a contributing factor, Mr Vaile said. WMC itself, however, has no objection in principle to being bought out, having spun off its aluminium operations in 2002 to make itself a more tempting target - as long as the price is right. Its stellar performance in 2004 has been built on sky-high prices for metals. Copper and nickel in particular have been in high demand thanks to China\\'s booming economy, which expanded more than 9% in each of the past two years. Nickel prices rose 43% during the year, with copper up 36%.\\n',\n",

Barclays\\' chief John Varley said the bank had \"caught the winds\" of a very strong world economy. Earnings at Barclays Capital investment bank rose 25% to Â£1.04bn, but investment in branch operations held back growth in its UK retail business.\\n \\n The group is the first of Britain\\'s five big banks to report 2004 results. According to analysts\\' forecasts, HSBC, the biggest UK bank by stock market valuation, will report profits of Â£9.4bn later this month.\\n \\n Barclays results were in line with market expectations. Its Global Investors wing made Â£347m, an 82% jump on 2003 figures. Profits at Barclaycard rose by 5% to Â£801m but were said to have been affected by a series of interest rate rises and investment to grow its customer base. The bank also blamed margins pressure on its mortgage business and spending on its branches over the past year for a 1% fall in profits in its UK retail division to Â£1.13bn.\\n \\n \"The outlook for 2005 is good as a result of balance sheet growth and investments made in 2004,\" Mr Varley said. Barclays cautioned that growth this year may be slower than in 2004 on the back of softer US and Chinese economies and the impact of interest rate rises on household spending in the UK. It added its bid to acquire a controlling stake in South Africa\\'s leading retail bank Absa, was being considered by regulatory authorities. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Mr Varley declined to be drawn on reports that Barclays had held merger talks with US bank Wells Fargo. A tie-up between Barclays and California-based Wells Fargo would create the world\\'s fourth biggest bank, valued at $180bn. At 1405 GMT, shares in Barclays were trading down 0.67% at 590 pence. \"The headline numbers are in line, but the story is costs,\" said analyst Alex Potter at Lehman Brothers. \"They are a bit more aggressive than we had expected. The cost overshoot is not in Barclays Capital but in the UK bank.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Yukos owner sues Russia for $28bn\\n \\n The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (Â£15.2bn).\\n \\n The Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos\\' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal. Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.\\n \\n The Russian government\\'s argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit\\'s full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk.\\n \\n But critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos\\' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. According to Menatep, the government\\'s actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. \"We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,\" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. \"The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today.\"\\n \\n Menatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to \"virtually nothing\" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government\\'s action, as its shares have fallen 97%. According to its Paris lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case. But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. \"Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,\" he said.\\n \\n Yukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep. He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.\\n',\n",

Analysts expected a figure closer to A$431m. Qantas shares fell almost 3%, however, after it warned that earnings growth would slow in the second half. Sales will dip by at least A$30m after the Indian ocean tsunami devastated many holiday destinations, Qantas said.\\n \\n \"The tsunami affected travel patterns in ways that we were a bit surprised about,\" chief executive Geoff Dixon explained. \"It certainly affected Japanese travel into Australia. As soon as the tsunami hit we saw ... a lessening with bookings for Australia.\" Higher fuel costs also are expected to eat into earnings in coming months. \"We don\\'t have as much hedging benefit in the second half as we had in the first,\" said chief financial officer Peter Gregg. Qantas is facing increased pressure from rivals such as low-cost carrier Virgin Blue and the Australian government is in talks about whether to allow Singapore Airlines to fly between the Australia and the US - one of Qantas\\' key routes.\\n \\n Even so, the firm is predicting that full-year earnings will increase from the previous 12 months. Analysts have forecast full-year profit will rise about 11% to around A$720 million ($563 million). Qantas boss Mr Dixon also said he would be reviewing the group\\'s cost-cutting measures. During the first six months of the fiscal year, Qantas made savings of A$245m, and is on track to top its target of A$500m for the full year. Last month, the company warned it may transfer as many as 7,000 jobs out Australia, with Mr Dixon quoted as saying that the carrier could no longer afford to remain \"all-Australian\".\\n',\n",

More than 240 civil and military aerospace firms from 31 countries are attending the show. Analysts said India could spend up to $35bn (Â£18.8bn) in the aviation market over the next 20 years. Giants such Boeing and Airbus - on the civil aviation front - as well as Lockheed Martin and France\\'s Snecma - on the military side - are some of the firms attending the show. \"There is tremendous scope for outsourcing from India in areas where the companies are competitive,\" said Mr Mukerjee. \"We are keen to welcome international collaborations that are in conformity with our national goals.\"\\n \\n Lockheed said it had signed an agreement with state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) to share information on the P-3 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft.\\n \\n In fact, the Indian Armed Force is considering the buying of used P-3 Orion as well as F-16 fighter jets from Lockheed. The US military industry has show a strong interest to open a link with India, now that relations between the two countries have improved a lot. In fact, it is the first time the US Air Force will attend the air show since sanctions imposed in 1998 after India\\'s nuclear tests were lifted. But the Indian Air Force is also considering proposals from other foreign firms such as France\\'s Dassault Aviation, Sweden\\'s Saab and Russia\\'s Mikoyan-Gurevich.

       " 'Russian oil merger excludes Yukos\\n \\n The merger of Russian gas giant Gazprom and oil firm Rosneft is to go ahead, but will not include Yugansk, which was controversially bought last year.\\n \\n The merger, backed by Russian authorities, will allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom shares. Gazprom chief Alexei Miller confirmed Rosneft-owned Yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off. Under the agreement, the state will get a controlling share of Gazprom in exchange for Rosneft. The state wanted to control Gazprom before allowing foreigners to trade. Speaking on NTV television, which is controlled by Gazprom, Mr Miller added that Yugansk, which was swallowed up by Rosneft late last year, will operate as a separate, state-owned oil firm headed by current Rosneft chief Sergei Bogdanchikov. According to reports from Russian News Agency Interfax, the deal should go through in the next two to three months.\\n \\n \"Obtaining majority control over Gazprom is the beginning of the liberalisation of the market in Gazprom shares,\" Mr Miller added. By opening up trading in Gazprom to foreigners, the firm will become a top emerging market play for traders. Currently, foreigners can only trade in Gazprom via a small issue of London-listed proxy shares. \"This is positive news for the international investment community,\" Global Asset Management investment chief David Smith said. \"The majority of investors are going to be happy,\" he added.\\n \\n However, analysts were disappointed that Yugansk would not be included in the deal. \"Yugansk is a heavy cashflow generator and would have been a much better asset for Gazprom,\" Renaissance Capital energy analyst Adam Landes told Reuters news agency. But he said the latest development was simply an interim step to allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom. \"Ultimately and industrially, Gazprom needs Yugansk,\" he added. Analysts said the deal would give Gazprom control of 8% of Russia\\'s total oil production, an improvement on its current 2.5%, but still far less than the 20% share it would have gained had it also taken over Yugansk. However, the merged group will still remain outside Russia\\'s top five oil producers - led by Lukoil with 11% of the market , followed by TNK-BP which is half owned by BP, and Surgutneftegaz. Instead, the merged Gazprom-Rosneft group will rank alongside Sibneft with 7% of the market. Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company in a disputed auction in December, following what many thought was a politically-motivated attack on Yukos. The shell company was then snapped up by Rosneft. Yukos unsuccessfully sought to halt the auction by applying for bankruptcy through the US courts. The unit was auctioned by Russian authorities to help pay off a $27.5bn back-tax bill.\\n',\n",

The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world\\'s biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev\\'s products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It\\'s the Brazil business that\\'s doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev\\'s strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil\\'s beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev\\'s European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.\\n',\n",

Prime Minister Ephraim Inoni, who vowed to tackle corruption when he came to office last year, said those found guilty would face tough punishments. The scam is believed to have begun in 1994.\\n \\n The prime minister\\'s office said the alleged fraud was uncovered during an investigation into the payroll at the ministry. In certain cases, staff are said to have lied about their rank and delayed their retirement in order to boost their earnings. The prime minister\\'s office said auditors had found \"irregularities in the career structure of certain civil servants\". It added that the staff in question \"appear to have received unearned salaries, boosting the payroll\".\\n \\n Fidelis Nanga, a journalist based in the Cameroon capital Yaounde, said the government was considering taking criminal action against those found guilty and forcing them to repay any money owed. \"The prime minister has given instructions for exemplary penalties to be meted out against the accused and their accomplices if found guilty,\" he told the BBC\\'s Network Africa programme.\\n \\n Mr Inoni launched an anti-corruption drive in December after foreign investors criticised a lack of transparency in the country\\'s public finances. In one initiative designed to improve efficiency, civil servants who arrived late for work were locked out of their offices. The government now intends to carry out an audit of payrolls at all other government ministries.

       " 'US adds more jobs than expected\\n \\n The US economy added 337,000 jobs in October - a seven-month high and far more than Wall Street expectations.\\n \\n In a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected President George W Bush, the Labor Department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains. Jobs were created in every sector of the US economy except manufacturing. While the separate unemployment rate went up to 5.5% from 5.4% in September, this was because more people were now actively seeking work.\\n \\n The 337,000 new jobs added to US payrolls in October was twice the 169,000 figure that Wall Street economists had forecast. In addition, the Labor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139,000 in September instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in August instead of 128,000. The better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in New York, with the main Dow Jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 by late morning trading. \"It looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year,\" said economist Gary Thayer of AG Edwards & Sons.\\n \\n Other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when it meets next week. \"It should empower the Fed to clearly do something,\" said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist with Eaton Vance Management in Boston. Kathleen Utgoff, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor, said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in October were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in Florida, and neighbouring Deep South states, following four hurricanes in August and September. The dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro, as investors returned their attention to other economic factors, such as the US\\'s record trade deficit. There is also speculation that President Bush will deliberately try to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports.\\n',\n",
       " 'Feta cheese battle reaches court\\n \\n A row over whether only Greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the European Court of Justice.\\n \\n The Danish and German governments are challenging a European Commission ruling which said Greece should have sole rights to use the name. The Commission\\'s decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to Italian Parma ham and French Champagne. But critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term, with the cheese produced widely outside Greece.\\n \\n The Commission\\'s controversial 2002 ruling gave \"protected designation of origin\" status to feta cheese made in Greece, effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there.\\n \\n From 2007 onwards, Greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in Europe must find another name to describe their products. The German and Danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years. \"In our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese,\" Hans Arne Kristiansen, a spokesman for the Danish Dairy Board, told the BBC. Denmark is Europe\\'s second largest producer of feta after Greece - producing about 30,000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to Greece. It is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in Denmark such as brie. \"It would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation,\" Mr Kristiansen said. \"That is just one of the costs.\"\\n \\n The case will also have a major impact on Britain\\'s sole feta producer, Yorkshire company Shepherds Purse Cheeses.\\n \\n Judy Bell, the company\\'s founder, said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product. \"If we lose we will have to go through a massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation,\" she said. \"We have never tried to pull the wool over anyone\\'s eyes - it\\'s very clear from the label that it\\'s Yorkshire feta.\" The original decision was a victory for Greece, where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6,000 years. Feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat\\'s milk, and is an essential ingredient in Greek cuisine. Greece makes 115,000 tonnes, mainly for domestic consumption. The Court is expected to reach a verdict in the case in the autumn.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ukraine revisits state sell-offs\\n \\n Ukraine is preparing what could be a wholesale review of the privatisation of thousands of businesses by the previous administration.\\n \\n The new President, Viktor Yushchenko, has said a \"limited\" list of companies is being drawn up. But on Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms. The government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rock-bottom prices. More than 90,000 businesses in all, from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts, have been sold off since 1992, as the command economy built up when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union was dismantled.\\n \\n Ms Tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3,000 businesses which were to be reviewed. \"We will return to the state that which was illegally put into private hands.\"\\n \\n A day earlier, Mr Yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted. The list \"will be limited and final, and will not be extended after its completion\", he said. An open-ended list could further damage outside investors\\' fragile faith in Ukraine, said Stuart Hensel of the Economist Intelligence Unit. But the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in Russia, Mr Hensel said. As a result, it was planning to resell rather than keep firms in state hands. \"They\\'re aware of the need not to scare investors, and to be careful of internal divides within Ukraine,\" he said. \"They don\\'t want to be seen to be transferring assets from one set of oligarchs to a new set.\" Foreign investment in Ukraine, at about $40 a head in 2004, is one of the lowest among ex-Soviet states.\\n \\n Mr Yushchenko became president after two elections in December, the first of which was annulled amid allegations of voting irregularities and massive street protests.\\n \\n His opponent, Viktor Yanukovich, still has huge support in the country\\'s eastern industrial heartland. Mr Yushchenko\\'s administration has accused its predecessor, led by ex-President Leonid Kuchma, of corruption. The privatisation review\\'s number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included Viktor Pinchuk, Mr Kuchma\\'s son-in-law, for $800m (Â£424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups. The mill, Krivorizhstal, is one of the world\\'s most profitable. \"We say Krivorizhstal was stolen, and at any cost we will return it to the state,\" Mr Yushchenko told an investors\\' conference in Kiev.\\n \\n One of the jilted bidders, Netherlands-based group LNM, said it welcomed the possibility that the mill might be back on the market.\\n \\n \"If the original privatisation is annulled and a new tender issued, then we would look at it with great interest,\" a spokesman told BBC News. A resale of Krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit\\'s Mr Hensel. But he warned that the government could decide to take the easy route of revaluing the company and charging the existing owners the revised price rather than undertaking a fresh sale. \"That way, Mr Yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules,\" he told BBC News.\\n',\n",

Economic growth slowed in the previous quarter, as manufacturing output fell, while consumer confidence has slipped. There is also growing evidence that the previously booming UK housing market is now cooling.\\n \\n House prices fell 0.4% in October, according to the Nationwide, their biggest monthly fall since February 2001. Last month, Bank of England governor Mervyn King said that the economy had hit a \"softer patch\" after rapid economic growth in the first half of 2004. Richard Jeffrey, chief economist at Bridgewell Securities, said it was very unlikely that the Bank of England would put rates up again this time around. \"There have been sufficient signs in the economy of a slowdown to stay the Bank of England\\'s hand,\" he told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme.

Declines in the dollar have also contributed to the rising oil price. US crude was trading at $51.39 at 0710 GMT in Asian electronic trade on Wednesday. A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 at $51.15 in New York on Tuesday. Opec members said on Tuesday that, given such high prices, the cartel saw no reason to cut its output.\\n \\n Although below last year\\'s peak of $55.67 a barrel, which was reached in October, prices are now well above 2004\\'s average of $41.48. Brent crude also rose in London trading, adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close.\\n \\n Much of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. \"The primary factor is the weak dollar,\" said Victor Shum, a Singapore-based analyst with Purvin and Gertz. Expectations that a rebound in the dollar would halt the oil price rise were not immediately borne out on Wednesday morning, as oil prices carried on upwards as the dollar strengthened against the euro, the pound and the yen.\\n \\n Several Opec members said on Tuesday that a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. \"I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,\" Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya\\'s oil minister, told Reuters. \"I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel,\" he added.\\n',\n",

Speaking on German TV, Bert Ruerup said the panel\\'s earlier forecast of 1.4% was too optimistic and warned growth would be just 1% in 2005.\\n \\n The German government is trying to tackle the stubbornly-high levels of joblessness with a range of labour market reforms. At their centre is the \"Hartz-IV\" programme introduced in January to shake up welfare benefits and push people back into work - even if some of the jobs are heavily subsidised. The latest unemployment figures look set to increase the pressure on the government. Widely leaked to the German newspapers a day in advance, they produced screaming headlines criticising Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder\\'s Social Democrat-Green Party administration. Mr Schroeder had originally come into office promising to halve unemployment.\\n \\n Still, some measures suggest the picture is not quite so bleak. The soaring official unemployment figure follows a change in the methodology which pushed up the jobless rate by more than 500,000 in January. Adjusted for seasonal changes, the overall unemployment rate is 4.875 million people or 11.7%, up 0.3 percentage points from the previous month. Using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Germany had 3.97 million people out of work in January. And ILO-based figures also suggest that 14,000 new net jobs were created that month, taking the number of people employed to 38.9 million. The ILO defines an unemployed person as someone who in the previous four weeks had actively looked for work they could take up immediately.\\n',\n",

China\\'s Baoshan Iron and Steel Co. said it was delaying a share sale because of weak market conditions, adding it would raise steel prices to offset ore costs. The threat of higher raw material costs also hit industries such as carmakers. France\\'s Peugeot warned that its profits may decline this year as a result of the higher steel, plastic and commodity prices.\\n \\n Steelmakers have been enjoying record profits as demand for steel has risen, driven by the booming economies of countries such as China and India. Steel prices rose by 8% globally in January alone and by 24% in China.\\n \\n The boom times are far from over, but analysts say that earnings growth may slow. The share price fall was initially triggered by news that two of the world\\'s biggest iron ore suppliers had negotiated contracts at much-higher prices. Miners Rio Tinto and Cia. Vale Do Rio Dolce (CVRD) this week managed to boost by 72% the price of their iron ore, a key component of steel. Analysts had expected Japan\\'s Nippon to agree to a price rise of between 40% and 50%. Steel analyst Peter Fish, director of Sheffield-based consulting group MEPS, said the extent of CVRD\\'s price rise was \"uncharted territory\", adding that the steel industry \"hasn\\'t seen an increase of this magnitude probably in 50 years\". Analysts now expect other iron ore producers, such as Australia\\'s BHP Billiton, to seek annual price rises of up to 70%.\\n \\n The news triggered the share price weakness. \"It sparked worries that steel makers might not be able to increase product prices further [ to cover rising ore costs]\" explained Kazuhiro Takahashi of Daiwa Securities SMBC. In Europe, Arcelor shed 2.1% to 17.58 euros in Paris, with ThyssenKrupp dropping 1.7% to 16.87 euros. In London, Corus fell 2.2% to 55.57 pence. Japan\\'s biggest steel company Nippon Steel lost 2.5% to 270 yen, with closest rival JFE Holdings down 3.4%. China\\'s Baoshan, the country\\'s largest steel producer, said that the uncertainty surrounding the industry has prompted it to pull its planned share sale. The firm had been expected to offer 22.5bn yuan ($2.7bn) worth of shares to investors. No date has been given for when the 5 billion shares will come to the market. Baoshan stock climbed on news of the delay and its decision to increase the price of its steel by 10%.\\n',\n",

In contrast, he said, the popularity of van-style seven-seat vehicles and traditional saloon cars would fade. \"Customers are moving out of the mini-van (and) traditional concepts are not as attractive anymore,\" he said. \"We have decided that BMW will enter the [crossover] segment,\" he said in the clearest indication yet about the car maker\\'s intentions.\\n \\n Mr Panke praised the Honda Accura as the \"best execution\" yet of a crossover vehicle. \"We have decided that the BMW brand will enter the segment,\" he said.\\n \\n A decision on just how BMW will manage its entry into the new market is due in the first half of 2005. Typically it takes about three years from when a decision is taken before a new model hits the streets, Mr Panke said, implying that a BMW crossover could be on the market by 2008. The coming switch is driven in part by the need for successful carmakers to stay aware of trans-Atlantic differences in the car market, Mr Panke insisted. While in the US drivers tend to prefer sports utility vehicles (SUVs), such as the BMW X5 and its sibling X3, in Europe demand for crossover vehicles is likely to be considerable, Mr Panke said. \"There\\'s a growing market here,\" he said. \"We are going to go that way.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Asian banks halt dollar\\'s slide\\n \\n The dollar regained some lost ground against most major currencies on Wednesday after South Korea and Japan denied they were planning a sell-off.\\n \\n The dollar suffered its biggest one-day fall in four months on Tuesday on fears that Asian central banks were about to lower their reserves of dollars. Japan is the biggest holder of dollar reserves in the world, with South Korea the fourth largest. The dollar was buying 104.76 yen at 0950 GMT, 0.5% stronger on the day. It also edged higher against both the euro and the pound, with one euro worth $1.3218, and one pound buying $1.9094. Concerns over rising oil prices and the outlook for the dollar pushed down US stock markets on Tuesday; the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 1.6%, while the Nasdaq lost 1.3%.\\n \\n The dollar\\'s latest slide began after a South Korean parliamentary report suggested the country, which has about $200bn in foreign reserves, had plans to boost holdings of currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollar. On Wednesday, however, South Korea moved to steady the financial markets. It issued a statement that \"The Bank of Korea will not change the portfolio of currencies in its reserves due to short term market factors\". Japan, too, steadied nerves. A senior Japanese Finance Ministry official told Reuters \"we have no plans to change the composition of currency holdings in the foreign reserves, and we are not thinking about expanding our euro holdings\". Japan has $850bn in foreign exchange reserves. At the start of the year, the US currency, which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows, staged something of a recovery. Analysts, however, pointed to the dollar\\'s inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data, and highlighted the fact that many of the US\\'s economic problems had not disappeared. The focus has been on the country\\'s massive trade and budget deficits, and analysts have predicted more dollar weakness to come.\\n',\n",

The owner of brands such as Dairy Milk, Dr Pepper and Snapple generates more than 80% of its sales outside the UK. Cadbury said it was confident it would hit its targets for 2005. \"While the external commercial environment remains competitive, we are confident that we have the strategy, brands and people to deliver within our goal ranges in 2005,\" said chief executive Todd Stitzer.\\n \\n The modest profit rise had been expected by analysts after the company said in December that the poor summer weather had hit soft drink sales in Europe.\\n \\n Cadbury said its underlying sales were up by 4% in 2004. Growth was helped by its confectionery brands - including Cadbury, Trident and Halls - which enjoyed a \"successful\" year, with like-for-like sales up 6%. Drinks sales were up 2% with strong growth in US carbonated soft drinks, led by Dr Pepper and diet drinks, offset by the weaker sales in Europe. Cadbury added that its Fuel for Growth cost-cutting programme had saved Â£75m in 2004, bringing total cost savings to Â£100m since the scheme began in mid-2003. The programme is set to close 20% of the group\\'s factories and shed 10% of the workforce. Cadbury Schweppes employs more than 50,000 people worldwide, with about 7,000 in the UK.\\n',\n",

He said that high oil prices meant Opec was unlikely to stick to its plan to cut output in the second quarter. In London, Brent crude fell 32 cents to $49.74 a barrel.\\n \\n Opec members are next meeting to discuss production levels on 16 March. On Monday, oil prices rose for a sixth straight session, reaching a four-month high as cold weather in the US threatened stocks of heating oil. US demand for heating oil was predicted to be about 14% above normal this week, while stocks were currently about 7.5% below the levels of a year ago. Cold weather across Europe has also put upward pressure on crude prices.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Winn-Dixie files for bankruptcy\\n \\n US supermarket group Winn-Dixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after succumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by Wal-Mart.\\n \\n Winn-Dixie, once among the most profitable of US grocers, said Chapter 11 protection would enable it to successfully restructure. It said its 920 stores would remain open, but analysts said it would most likely off-load a number of sites. The Jacksonville, Florida-based firm has total debts of $1.87bn (Â£980m). In its bankruptcy petition it listed its biggest creditor as US foods giant Kraft Foods, which it owes $15.1m.\\n \\n Analysts say Winn-Dixie had not kept up with consumers\\' demands and had also been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading. A 10-month restructuring plan was deemed a failure, and following a larger-than-expected quarterly loss earlier this month, Winn-Dixie\\'s slide into bankruptcy was widely expected. The company\\'s new chief executive Peter Lynch said Winn-Dixie would use the Chapter 11 breathing space to take the necessary action to turn itself around. \"This includes achieving significant cost reductions, improving the merchandising and customer service in all locations and generating a sense of excitement in the stores,\" he said. Yet Evan Mann, a senior bond analyst at Gimme Credit, said Mr Lynch\\'s job would not be easy, as the bankruptcy would inevitably put off some customers. \"The real big issue is what\\'s going to happen over the next one or two quarters now that they are in bankruptcy and all their customers see this in their local newspapers,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Why few targets are better than many\\n \\n The economic targets set out at the Lisbon summit of European Union leaders in 2000 were meant to help Europe leapfrog its way past the United States to become the world\\'s leading economy by 2010.\\n \\n But the Lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige. For many economists and analysts they are about ensuring Europe doesn\\'t become a global economic laggard. They are also about ensuring Europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of Asia, India and China, as well as with the economic might of the United States. That\\'s why there was a tone of urgency in the report, out on Wednesday, by the former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok. Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the Lisbon targets, five years on from their inception. His conclusion was simple: too many of the targets will be seriously missed.\\n \\n Lisbon risks becoming a \"synonym for missed objectives and failed promises\", his report said. \"The status quo is not an option.\"\\n \\n At risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society Europe has built, it said. The report comes at a time when Europe\\'s competitive position is waning. The EU\\'s economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next. While there has been growth in overall employment rates in Europe, productivity lags behind that of the US. But meeting the Lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no EU member state has volunteered so far. That has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years.\\n \\n As Mr Kok\\'s report noted: \"The ink had scarcely dried on the [Lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded.\" \"The US suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the European economy followed suit.\"\\n \\n The circumstances weren\\'t conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by EU leaders in Lisbon in 2000. Neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development, money needed if the EU was to meet its target of becoming a so-called \"knowledge-based economy\". \"The [Lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change,\" said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council, a Brussels-based citizen action group. \"What you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change. You find trade unions fighting change. But also the employers\\' associations. \"Even though they tell you they\\'re in favour of change, many are actually pushing for less competition, more subsidy and less free market activity.\"\\n \\n But part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in Lisbon five years ago. Targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the Lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the Wim report. Economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion, and even safety at sea. The agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised.\\n \\n \"Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing,\" the Kok report said. \"Everybody is responsible and thus no one.\" That\\'s why the Kok report recommends that the Lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth. It also recommends that the European Commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they\\'re taking towards meeting the targets, effectively \"naming, shaming and faming\". \"Rhetoric and delivery don\\'t necessarily go hand in hand,\" Mr Kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report. \"We don\\'t have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another.\"\\n \\n On one point Mr Kok was very clear: The European Union should not try to emulate the US economy. The European economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth. In that sense, the Lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters. The Kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth. \"It\\'s very ambitious,\" said John Palmer, political director at the European Policy Centre, a Brussels-based think-tank. \"This is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do. It\\'s going to require quite new and innovative policies.\" But some analysts believe that the Kok report doesn\\'t come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets a reality. For example, it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce. But it doesn\\'t say how companies should be convinced to do this. It will be up to the incoming president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, to adopt Mr Kok\\'s recommendations and press them on EU governments. Mr Barroso has said that the EU\\'s competitiveness will be his top priority. He expects his five-year term in office to be judged on Europe\\'s success in meeting the Lisbon agenda.\\n',\n",

RHB, Malaysia's third-biggest lender, is already scouting for a foreign partner for its new Islamic banking unit, the firm told Reuters. The moves put Malaysia ahead of a 2007 deadline to open up the sector. The country's deal to join the World Trade Organisation set that year as a deadline for liberalisation of Islamic banking. Also on Tuesday, the central bank released growth figures showing Malaysia's economy expanded 7.1% in 2004. But growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter to 5.6%, and the central bank said it expected 6% expansion in 2005.\\n \\n Malaysia changed the law to allow Islamic banking in 1983. It has granted licences to three Middle Eastern groups, which - along with local players - mean there are eight fully-operational Islamic banking groups in the country. Islamic banks offer services which permit modern banking principles while sticking to Islamic law's ban on the payment of interest. Most of the Malays which make up half the country's population are Muslims.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Alfa Romeos \\'to get GM engines\\'\\n \\n Fiat is to stop making six-cylinder petrol engines for its sporty Alfa Romeo subsidiary, unions at the Italian carmaker have said.\\n \\n The unions claim Fiat is to close the Fiat Powertrain plant at Arese near Milan and instead source six-cylinder engines from General Motors. Fiat has yet to comment on the matter, but the unions say the new engines will be made by GM in Australia. The news comes a week after GM pulled out of an agreement to buy Fiat. GM had to pay former partner Fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; Â£1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the Italian carmaker outright. Fiat and GM also ended their five-year alliance and two joint ventures in engines and purchasing, but did agree to continue buying each other\\'s engines.\\n \\n \"Powertrain told us today that Alfa Romeo engines will no longer be made in Arese,\" said union leader Vincenzo Lilliu, as reported by the Reuters news agency. \"The assembly line will be dismantled and the six-cylinder Alfa Romeo motor will be replaced with an engine GM produces in Australia.\" Reuters also said that Mr Lilliu and other union bosses shouted insults at Fiat chairman Luca di Montezemolo, following a meeting on Tuesday regarding the future of the Arese plant. The unions said the end of engine production at the facility would mean the loss of 800 jobs. All Alfa Romeo models can be bought with a six-cylinder engine - the 147, 156, 156 Sportwagon, 166, GTV, GT and Spider.\\n',\n",
       " 'Saab to build Cadillacs in Sweden\\n \\n General Motors, the world\\'s largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden.\\n \\n The car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster. As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine.\\n \\n GM\\'s announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory\\'s closure. The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about GM\\'s planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations. But the group\\'s new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group\\'s Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany. They may now have to face a larger proportion of GM\\'s cuts.\\n \\n Neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saab\\'s failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market. For years, Saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. The segment\\'s leaders do not agree.\\n \\n GM\\'s plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. In the US, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. Yet it could prove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe. Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe. There, German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market.\\n \\n Bringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. That is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and Saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (Â£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year. Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations, GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. Another way to further reduce Saab\\'s losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car. Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers. But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. \"We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today,\" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News. The current trend towards US production was \"stupid\", he said.\\n \\n In a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models. It is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US. GM said it wanted to change \"customers\\' perceptions\" about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.\\n',\n",

The firms took action after the death from a central nervous system disease and a suspected case of the condition. The cases cited involved the use of both Tysabri and Avonex, Biogen Idec\\'s existing multiple sclerosis drug. The companies said they have no reports of the rare condition - progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - in patients taking either Tysabri or Avonex alone. Tysabri was approved for use in the US last November and was widely tipped to become the world\\'s leading multiple sclerosis treatment.\\n \\n \"The companies will work with clinical investigators to evaluate Tysabri-treated patients and will consult with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of PML,\" the two firms said in a statement. \"The outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine possible re-initiation of dosing in clinical trials and future commercial availability.\"\\n \\n Analysts had believed the product would provide a new growth opportunity for Biogen Idec, which had faced increased competition from rivals to Avonex. Elan, once the biggest firm on the Irish stock exchange, was also expected to receive a boost, from the new product. An inquiry into Elan\\'s accounts in 2002 brought the group close to bankruptcy but the firm has been rebuilding itself since, with its share price increasing by almost four-fold last year. \"Most of the value in the company was in Tysabri,\" said Ian Hunter at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin. \"Now there\\'s a question mark over it.\" Elan finished down $18.90 at $8, while Biogen fell $28.63 to $38.65.\\n \\n - Shares in UK pharmaceutical firm Phytopharm closed down 19.84% at 151.5 pence on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, after it said a partner was set to pull out of a deal on an experimental Alzheimer\\'s disease treatment.

The news surprised some analysts who had expected the latest minutes to show another unanimous decision. Worries over growth rates and consumer spending were behind the decision to freeze rates, the minutes showed. The Bank\\'s latest inflation report, released last week, had noted that the main reason inflation might fall was weaker consumer spending.\\n \\n However, MPC member Paul Tucker voted for a quarter point rise in interest rates to 5%. He argued that economic growth was picking up, and that the equity, credit and housing markets had been stronger than expected.\\n \\n The Bank\\'s minutes said that risks to the inflation forecast were \"sufficiently to the downside\" to keep rates on hold at its latest meeting. However, the minutes added: \"Some members noted that an increase might be warranted in due course if the economy evolved in line with the central projection\". Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said he was surprised that a dissenting vote had been made so soon. He said the minutes appeared to be \"trying to get the market to focus on the possibility of a rise in rates\". \"If the economy pans out as they expect then they are probably going to have to hike rates.\" However, he added, any rate increase is not likely to happen until later this year, with MPC members likely to look for a more sustainable pick up in consumer spending before acting.\\n',\n",
       " 'Crude oil prices back above $50\\n \\n Cold weather across parts of the United States and much of Europe has pushed US crude oil prices above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost three months.\\n \\n Freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall have increased demand for heating fuel in the US, where stocks are low. Fresh falls in the value of the dollar helped carry prices above the $50 mark for the first time since November. A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday. Opec members said on Tuesday that it saw no reason to cut its output.\\n \\n Although below last year\\'s peak of $55.67 a barrel, which was reached in October, prices are now well above 2004\\'s average of $41.48.\\n \\n Brent crude also rose in London trading, adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close. Much of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. \"The dollar moved sharply overnight and oil is following it,\" said Chris Furness, senior market strategist at 4Cast. \"If the dollar continues to weaken, oil will be obviously higher.\"\\n \\n Several Opec members said a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. \"I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,\" Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya\\'s oil minister, told Reuters. \"I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel,\" he added. Opec closely watches global stocks to ensure that there is not an excessive supply in the market. The arrival of spring in the northern hemisphere will focus attention on stockpiles of US crude and gasoline, which are up to 9% higher than at this time last year. Heavy stockpiles could help force prices lower when demand eases.\\n',\n",
       " 'House prices show slight increase\\n \\n Prices of homes in the UK rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in February, says the Nationwide building society.\\n \\n The figure means the annual rate of increase in the UK is down to 10.2%, the lowest rate since June 2001. The annual rate has halved since August last year, as interest rises have cooled the housing market. At the same time, the number of mortgage approvals fell in January to a near 10-year low, official Bank of England figures have shown.\\n \\n Nationwide said that in January house prices went up by 0.4% on the month and by 12.6% on a year earlier. \"We are not seeing the market collapsing in the way some had feared,\" said Nationwide economist Alex Bannister. There have been a number of warnings that the UK housing market may be heading for a downturn after four years of strong growth to 2004. In November, Barclays, which owns former building society the Woolwich, forecast an 8% fall in property prices in 2005, followed by further declines in 2006 and 2007. And last summer, economists at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) warned house prices were overvalued and could fall by between 10% and 15% by 2009.\\n \\n The price of an average UK property now stands at Â£152,879. Homeowners now expect house prices to rise by 1% over the next six months, Mr Bannister said. He said if the growth continued at this level then the Bank of England may increase interest rates from their current 4.75%.\\n \\n \"I think the key is what the Bank expects to happen to the housing market. We always thought we would see a small rise, they thought they would see a small decline.\" House prices have risen 0.9% this year, Nationwide said, and if this pace of increase persists, prices would rise by just under 6% in the year to December. This is slightly above the 0-5% range Nationwide predicts.\\n \\n Further evidence of a slowdown in the housing market emerged from Bank of England lending figures released on Tuesday. New mortgage loans in January fell to 79,000 from 82,000 in December, the bank said. The past few months have seen approvals fall to levels last seen in 1995. The Bank revealed that 48,000 fewer mortgages were approved in January than for the same month in 2004. Overall, mortgage lending rose by Â£7.2bn in January, marginally up on the Â£7.1bn rise in December.\\n',\n",

It comes just weeks ahead of the Budget and an expected general election. Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: \"At best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government.\"\\n \\n A review by the ONS found it had made a mistake by \"double counting\" some spending on roads since 1998/9. Correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment, thus helping Mr Brown to meet his \"golden rule\" of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle. Economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the Budget.\\n \\n The changes by the ONS increase the current budget measure for the past five years by Â£2.1bn in total. Mr Letwin said: \"This is a very murky area... There will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled.\" The Conservatives also said Mr Brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual Â£10.5bn \"black hole\" in the nation\\'s coffers. But the Treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions.\\n \\n In January the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Mr Brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year\\'s Budget. It also said the government might narrowly miss its \"golden rule\" if the current economic cycle ended in 2005/06. After the ONS announcement, economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about Â£400m. \"None of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years,\" said Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. \"Accordingly, it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course.\"\\n',\n",

The combined firm will operate about 1,000 stores across the US, with combined annual sales of $30bn. The two companies, facing competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, tried to merge two years ago but talks failed. Sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after May\\'s chairman and chief executive Gene Kahn resigned in January. As part of the deal, Federated - owner of Macy\\'s and Bloomingdale\\'s - will assume $6bn of May\\'s debt, bringing the deal\\'s total value to $17bn. Directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year.\\n \\n May has struggled to compete against larger department store groups such as Federated and other retailers such as Wal-Mart. Federated expects the merger to boost earnings from 2007 but the deal will cost it $1bn in one-off charges.\\n \\n \"We have taken the first step toward combining two of the best department store companies in America, creating a new retail company with truly national scope and presence,\" said Terry Lundgren, Federated\\'s chairman. Some analysts see the merger as a rescue deal for May. \"Without this deal May would have been, to put it bluntly, washed up,\" said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard\\'s Retail Consulting Group. Federated has annual sales of $15.6bn, while May\\'s yearly sales are $14.4bn.\\n',\n",
       " 'Industrial revival hope for Japan\\n \\n Japanese industry is growing faster than expected, boosting hopes that the country\\'s retreat back into recession is over.\\n \\n Industrial output rose 2.1% - adjusted for the time of year - in January from a month earlier. At the same time, retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 1997. The news sent Tokyo shares to an eight-month high, as investors hoped for a recovery from the three quarters of contraction seen from April 2004 on. The Nikkei 225 index ended the day up 0.7% at 11,740.60 points, with the yen strengthening 0.7% against the dollar to 104.53 yen. Weaker exports, normally the engine for Japan\\'s economy in the face of weak domestic demand, had helped trigger a 0.1% contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking GDP. Only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline. The output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic officials. \"Overall I see a low risk of the economy falling into serious recession,\" said Bank of Japan chief Toshihiko Fukui, despite warning that other indicators - such as the growth numbers - had been worrying.\\n \\n Within the overall industrial output figure, there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown. Among the best-performing sectors were key overseas sales areas such as cars, chemicals and electronic goods. With US growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in early 2005 could also be one of sustained demand. Electronics were also one of the keys to the improved domestic market, with products such as flat-screen TVs in high demand during January.\\n',\n",

The pair claim they are being punished by the authorities for the political ambitions of Mr Khodorkovsky. Mr Lebedev said there were \"absurd contradictions\" in the case. Opening his defence, he said he could not see the legal basis of the charges he faced, which also include allegations of tax evasion. \"To my embarrassment, I could not understand the file of complaints against me,\" he told a Moscow court. Mr Lebedev headed the Menatep group, the parent company of Yukos.\\n \\n Mr Lebedev and Mr Khodorkovsky, who each face a possible 10 year jail sentence if convicted, will be questioned by a judge over the next few days. Mr Khodorkovsky began his testimony last week, telling the court that he objected to the way that the \"running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction\". The charges are seen by supporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country\\'s super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs. Yukos has been presented with a $27.5bn (Â£13bn) tax demand by the Russian authorities and its key Yugansk division was auctioned off to part settle the bill.

US oil giant ExxonMobil signed up for a $12.8bn deal earlier on Sunday. France's Total is expected to join the ExxonMobil scheme, dubbed Qatargas-2, on Monday, taking 5 million tonnes of LNG a year. ExxonMobil will be taking some 15 million tonnes each year for 25 years from the end of 2007 under the deal.

The priority for Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram is to fight poverty and keep the government\\'s Communist allies onside. But his options are limited by a new law which makes him cut the budget deficit, which he said would be 4.5% of GDP in the year to March 2005. The country\\'s overall deficit is thought to be more than 10%, if the spending of India\\'s 35 states and territories is included. Under the fiscal responsibility law, Mr Chidambaram has to trim the deficit by 0.3 percentage points each year, a target he says he has now met for the current year.\\n \\n But the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005-6 target for the deficit will be 4.3%, Mr Chidambaram said - falling short of the new law\\'s requirement. \"I was left with no option but to press the pause button vis a vis the act,\" he said. The following year, though, would have to be back on track, he warned.\\n \\n \"I may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means,\" he said. The coming year\\'s reduction has meant bringing more of the businesses in India\\'s burgeoning services sector into the tax system and restructuring the personal tax system, although there are numerous corporate tax and duty reductions built into the budget.\\n \\n Presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament, Mr Chidambaram said the Indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in. He said India\\'s economy grew 6.9% in 2004. In his budget Mr Chidambaram has:\\n \\n - Increased spending on primary education to 71.56bn rupees ($1.6bn) \\n  - Increased spending on health to 102.8bn rupees ($2.35bn) \\n  - Announced that 80bn rupees ($1.8bn) will be spent on building rural infrastructure \\n  - Pledged 102.16bn rupees ($2.3bn) for tsunami victims \\n  - Increased flow of funds to agriculture by 30% \\n  - Announced a package for the sugar industry\\n \\n In addition, up to 100bn rupees ($2.3bn) to be spent on infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the country\\'s foreign exchange reserves, keeping budgeted spending under control. \"Given the resilience of the Indian economy... it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty,\" Mr Chidambaram said. \"The whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty.\" The new Indian government, led by the Congress Party, was voted into power last May after it pledged to introduce economic reforms with a \"human face\".\\n \\n The finance minister says he is committed to continue reforming India\\'s tax system while expanding the tax base. As part of his reforms he has announced:\\n \\n - Duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials \\n  - Expanded service tax net \\n  - Raised the income-tax threshold to 100,000 rupees ($2,300) \\n  - Reduced income tax for those earning less than 250,000 rupees ($5,700) to 20% \\n  - Reduced corporate tax rates to 30%\\n \\n An annual economic survey released on Friday said India needed to ease limit restriction on foreign investment, reform labour laws and cut duties apart from widening the tax base for long-term economic growth. But Mr Chidambaram is under pressure from the Communist parties to focus on increasing social spending. The Communists are also hostile to measures seeking to increase foreign investment and allow companies to hire and fire employees at will. In recent months, they have expressed their displeasure at the government\\'s economic reform plans including increasing foreign direct investment in telecommunication and aviation. In his last budget, Mr Chidambaram had pledged billions of dollars for improving education and health services for the poor as well as special assistance for farmers.\\n',\n",
       " 'GM pays $2bn to evade Fiat buyout\\n \\n General Motors of the US is to pay Fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; Â£1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the Italian car maker outright.\\n \\n Fiat had sold GM a stake in 2000, as part of a partnership agreement. But Fiat\\'s heavy losses have convinced GM - whose own European operations are in the red - to back away. The pay-off means the two firms will unwind joint ventures, but Fiat will keep supplying diesel engines and the money will allow it to reduce its debt. Fiat\\'s shares on the Milan stock exchange rose 4.5% by 0900 GMT to 6.2 euros, having shot up more than 7% in early trading. \"We now have absolute freedom to design our own future,\" said Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne.\\n \\n Analysts said Fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal, although some predictions had expected a 2bn euro pay-off. Fiat is to get 1bn euros immediately, with another 550m to follow within 90 days. The firm is Italy\\'s largest private employer, and a failure to reach an agreement could have had severe consequences for thousands of workers and for the Italian economy. For its part, GM was keen to ward off any criticism that the deal had been a mistake.\\n \\n \"We needed scale in Europe to get costs down, and we were able to do that in working with Fiat,\" said GM chief executive Rick Wagoner.\\n \\n The Fiat-GM alliance came about in 2000 as an alternative to selling Fiat outright. German-US car firm DaimlerChrysler had been willing to buy the firm, but Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli did not want to give up control. Instead, GM swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of Fiat - and gave Fiat a \"put option\" to sell GM the rest of the car maker between January 2004 and July 2009. But despite the alliance Fiat failed to put itself back on track, continuing to lose money and market share. As a result, the sell-off looked better and better for the Italians - and much worse for GM, which is struggling with its own loss-making European marques Opel and Saab. The relationship soured further after Fiat sold half its finance arm and recapitalised in 2003, halving GM\\'s stake to 10%.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ex-Boeing director gets jail term\\n \\n An ex-chief financial officer at Boeing has received a four-month jail sentence and a fine of $250,000 (Â£131,961) for illegally hiring a top Air Force aide.\\n \\n Michael Sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting Darleen Druyun while she still handled military contracts. Ms Druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring Boeing when awarding lucrative contracts. Boeing lost a $23bn government contract after a Pentagon inquiry into the case. The contract, to provide refuelling tankers for the US Air Force, was cancelled last year.\\n \\n The Pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth $3bn which it believes may have been tainted by Ms Druyun\\'s role in the procurement process. Boeing sacked Mr Sears and Ms Druyun in November 2003 after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy. Ms Druyun had talks with Mr Sears in October 2002 about working for Boeing, while she was still a top procurement official within the Pentagon. She subsequently joined the company in January 2003. Ms Druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to Boeing and other favoured companies.\\n \\n In documents filed in a Virginia court ahead of Mr Sears\\' sentencing, prosecutors blamed Boeing\\'s senior management for failing to ask key questions about the \"legal and ethical issues\" surrounding Ms Druyun\\'s appointment. Mr Sears told prosecutors that no other Boeing officials were aware that Ms Druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with Boeing. However, analysts believe Boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal. The Pentagon has investigated 400 contracts, dating back to 1993, since the allegations against Ms Druyun came to light.\\n \\n Boeing\\'s corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years. Boeing was sued by Lockheed Martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition. Boeing apologised publicly for the affair - although it claimed it did not gain any unfair advantage - and pledged to improve its procedures. The Pentagon subsequently revoked $1bn worth of contracts assigned to Boeing and prohibited the Seattle-based company from future rocket work.\\n',\n",
       " \"Verizon 'seals takeover of MCI'\\n \\n Verizon has won a takeover battle for US phone firm MCI with a bid worth $6.8bn (Â£3.6bn), reports say.\\n \\n The two firms are expected to seal the deal on Monday morning, according to news agency reports, despite what was thought to be a higher bid from Qwest. The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-distance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $16bn. MCI exited bankruptcy in April, having gone bust under previous name WorldCom. The bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits.\\n \\n Shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour, paying the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep Wall Street happy.\\n \\n MCI is the US's second-biggest long distance firm after AT&T. Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. A merger between MCI and Verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October. Last week, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. Buying MCI would give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers. The rationale is similar to the one underpinning SBC's AT&T deal. Verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares.\\n\",\n",
       " 'US data sparks inflation worries\\n \\n Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.\\n \\n New figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university\\'s index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor\\'s 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.\\n \\n The economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.\\n \\n Mr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. \"The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,\" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. \"But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.\"\\n \\n Consumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. \"The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,\" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor\\'s. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was \"much less alarming\" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which \"are no indication of broad PPI pressure\", were responsible for the increase, he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said \"it is a good bet these increases won\\'t stick\".\\n',\n",
       " \"Yukos sues four firms for $20bn\\n \\n Russian oil firm Yukos has sued four companies for their role in last year's forced state auction of its key oil production unit Yuganskneftegas.\\n \\n Yukos is claiming more than $20bn (Â£11bn) in damages after Yugansk was sold in December to settle back taxes. The four companies named in the law suit are gas giant Gazprom, its unit Gazpromneft, investment company Baikal, and state oil firm Rosneft. Yukos submitted the suit in Houston, where it filed for bankruptcy. As well as suing for damages, Yukos has asked the US court to send its tax dispute with the Russian government to an international arbitrator. It also has submitted a reorganisation plan as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\\n \\n The clash between Yukos and the Kremlin came to a head last year when Yukos was hit with a bill of more than $27bn in back taxes and unpaid fines. To settle the bill, Russia forced Yukos to sell off Yuganskneftegas.\\n \\n Yukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the US in an effort to regain control of the oil production business. It also has vowed to use all legal means at its disposal to go after any firm that tries to buy or take control of its assets. Earlier this month it sued the Russian government for $28.3bn. Analysts have questioned whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies, while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos' legal wrangling as meaningless. In Houston, bankruptcy Judge Letitia Clark will start a two-day hearing on 16 February to hear arguments on whether a US court is the proper forum for the case.\\n \\n The threat of legal action from Yukos and its bankruptcy filing in Houston did have an effect on last year's auction, however. Concerned that it would be caught up in a court battle, Gazprom and Gazpromneft withdrew from the auction, and Yuganskneftegas was sold to little-known investment firm Baikal Finance Group. A few days later, Baikal gave control of the company to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn. Rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with Gazprom, bringing a large chunk of Russia's very profitable oil business back under state control. Yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, is in prison, having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.\\n\",\n",

The figure marked an increase on the 3.3% growth recorded in the second quarter, but fell short of the 4.2% rate pencilled in by forecasters. The increase reflected the biggest jump in consumer spending in a year. \"It was a little softer than the consensus, but not a real surprise,\" said Gary Thayer, an economist at AG Edwards & Sons. Friday\\'s growth estimate is one of the last significant pieces of economic data before the 2 November presidential election.\\n \\n Democrat challenger John Kerry has criticised President George W Bush\\'s handling of the economy, pointing to a net loss of over 800,000 jobs since Mr Bush took office. Analysts said the economy was still not growing fast enough to stimulate large-scale job creation. \"It\\'s a pretty good growth rate, but it may not be good enough to create enough jobs,\" said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics in New York. However, President Bush is expected to point to Commerce Department figures showing that consumer spending grew at 4.6% in the third quarter, up from just 1.6% in the second, as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth. Consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the US.\\n \\n The weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, economists said. \"The economy regained some traction in the third quarter, but the growth is not robust,\" AG Edwards\\' Thayer. \"I think that means the Fed can take its time raising rates. We\\'ll probably see one more rate hike before the end of the year.\" In an effort to pre-empt rising inflation, the Federal Reserve has pushed through three quarter-point rate rises since June this year, taking borrowing costs to 1.75%. On the financial markets, the dollar fell slightly against the euro and the yen, while the Dow Jones index of leading US shares was little changed.\\n',\n",

In contrast, the 12 Euro zone countries will put in a \"lacklustre\" performance, generating growth of only 1.8%. The global economy will slow in 2005, the UNECE forecasts, due to widespread weakness in consumer demand.\\n \\n It warned that growth could also be threatened by attempts to reduce the United States\\' huge current account deficit which, in turn, might lead to significant volatility in exchange rates.\\n \\n UNECE is forecasting average economic growth of 2.2% across the European Union in 2005. However, total output across the Euro zone is forecast to fall in 2004 from 1.9% to 1.8%. This is due largely to the faltering German economy, which shrank 0.2% in the last quarter of 2004. On Monday, Germany\\'s BdB private banks association said the German economy would struggle to meet its 1.4% growth target in 2005.\\n \\n Separately, the Bundesbank warned that Germany\\'s efforts to reduce its budget deficit below 3% of GDP presented \"huge risks\" given that headline economic growth was set to fall below 1% this year. Publishing its 2005 economic survey, the UNECE said central European countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovenia would provide the backbone of the continent\\'s growth. Smaller nations such as Cyprus, Ireland and Malta would also be among the continent\\'s best performing economies this year, it said. The UK economy, on the other hand, is expected to slow in 2005, with growth falling from 3.2% last year to 2.5%.\\n \\n Consumer demand will remain fragile in many of Europe\\'s largest countries and economies will be mostly driven by growth in exports. \"In view of the fragility of factors of domestic growth and the dampening effects of the stronger euro on domestic economic activity and inflation, monetary policy in the euro area is likely to continue to \\'wait and see\\', the organisation said in its report. Global economic growth is expected to fall from 5% in 2004 to 4.25% despite the continued strength of the Chinese and US economies. The UNECE warned that attempts to bring about a controlled reduction in the US current account deficit could cause difficulties. \"The orderly reversal of the deficit is a major challenge for policy makers in both the United States and other economies,\" it noted.\\n',\n",
       " 'Brewers\\' profits lose their fizz\\n \\n Heineken and Carlsberg, two of the world\\'s largest brewers, have reported falling profits after beer sales in western Europe fell flat.\\n \\n Dutch firm Heineken saw its annual profits drop 33% and warned that earnings in 2005 may also slide. Danish brewer Carlsberg suffered a 3% fall in profits due to waning demand and increased marketing costs. Both are looking to Russia and China to provide future growth as western European markets are largely mature.\\n \\n Heineken\\'s net income fell to 537m euros ($701m; Â£371m) during 2004, from 798m euro a year ago. It blamed weak demand in western Europe and currency losses. It had warned in September that the weakening US dollar, which has cut the value of foreign sales, would knock 125m euros off its operating profits. Despite the dip in profits, Heineken\\'s sales have been improving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros, up 8.1% from 9.26bn euros in 2003. Heineken said it now plans to invest 100m euros in \"aggressive\" and \"high-impact\" marketing in Europe and the US in 2005. Heineken, which also owns the Amstel and Murphy\\'s stout brands, said it would also seek to cut costs. This may involve closing down breweries.\\n \\n Heineken increased its dividend payment by 25% to 40 euro cents, but warned that the continued impact of a weaker dollar and an increased marketing spend may lead to a drop in 2005 net profit.\\n \\n Carlsberg, the world\\'s fifth-largest brewer, saw annual pre-tax profits fall to 3.4bn Danish kroner (456m euros). Its beer sales have been affected by the sluggish European economy and by the banning of smoking in pubs in several European countries. Nevertheless, total sales increased 4% to 36bn kroner, thanks to strong sales of Carlsberg lager in Russia and Poland. Carlsberg is more optimistic than Heineken about 2005, projecting a 15% rise in net profits for the year. However, it also plans to cut 200 jobs in Sweden, where sales have been hit by demand for cheap, imported brands. \"We remain cautious about the medium-to-long term outlook for revenue growth across western Europe for a host of economic, social and structural reasons,\" investment bank Merrill Lynch said of Carlsberg.\\n',\n",
       " 'Yangtze Electric\\'s profits double\\n \\n Yangtze Electric Power, the operator of China\\'s Three Gorges Dam, has said its profits more than doubled in 2004.\\n \\n The firm has benefited from increased demand for electricity at a time when power shortages have hit cities and provinces across the country. As a hydroelectric-power generator it has not been hurt by higher coal costs. Net income jumped to 3bn yuan in 2004 ($365m; Â£190m), compared with 1.4bn yuan in 2003. Sales surged to 6.2bn yuan, from 3bn yuan a year earlier. The figures topped analysts expectations, even though the rate of growth has slowed from 2003. Analysts forecast that it is likely to decline further this year to a rate of expansion of closer to 20%.\\n \\n Yangtze Electric has been expanding its output to meet demand driven by China\\'s booming economy. The government has delayed the building of a number of power plants in an effort to rein in growth amid concerns that the economy may overheat. That has led to an energy crunch, with demand outstripping supply. Earlier this month, work was halted on an underground power station, and a supply unit on the Three Gorges Dam, as well as a power station on its sister Xiluodu dam because of environmental worries. A total of 30 large-scale projects have been halted across the country for similar reasons. The Three Gorges Dam project has led to more than half a million people being relocated and drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. Its sister project, the Xiluodu Dam, is being built on the Jinshajiang - or \"river of golden sand\" as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known.\\n',\n",
       " 'French consumer spending rising\\n \\n French consumers increased their spending by 1.5% in January, a figure which bodes well for the country\\'s economic growth, figures revealed.\\n \\n The National Statistic Institute (INSEE) added that consumer spending in January rose 3.8% on a year-on-year basis. Rising sales of household equipment were behind the increase. The INSEE also said that French consumer prices fell 0.6% in January, but were up 1.6% on an annual basis.\\n \\n Despite the general increase in spending in January, French households bought fewer cars in January. According to the INSEE, car sales fell 2.8% in January, following a fall of 0.6% in December. But on a year-on-year basis, the sector still saw a sales increase of 6.5%. Consumer spending fuelled France\\'s economic growth in the last quarter of 2004 and analysts expect that it will continue to support the economy. \"It\\'s a growth that will remain fragile and vulnerable to risks like a strong rise in long-term interest rates, tension in the oil price,\" Emmanuel Ferry, from Exane BNP Paribas told Reuters news agency.\\n \\n Meanwhile in Italy, consumer confidence rose to its highest level since October 2004. Economic research group ISAE has said that Italian consumer confidence rose to 104.4 from 103.3, despite a slight deterioration in short-term sentiment.\\n',\n",
       " \"GSK aims to stop Aids profiteers\\n \\n One of the world's largest manufacturers of HIV/Aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills - supplied to poorer African countries - back into Europe for resale at far higher price.\\n \\n The company, GlaxoSmithKline, is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills, currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement. It is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way. This is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies. They want to maintain their profits, but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti-Aids drugs to the world's poorest nations.\\n \\n The result is that drugs supplied to Africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in Europe; bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of HIV-positive Africans through their government's health care systems.\\n \\n But the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re-selling them at a higher price. GlaxoSmithKline believes that by coating the pills destined for Africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging, then this trade can be substantially reduced. The company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in Africa who have re-sold humanitarian drugs for profit, as well as those suppliers in Europe that have also been involved in the trade. Glaxo says distribution of the new-look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in Europe.\\n\",\n",

The comments came as it reported a 6% rise in profits to Â£280.2m ($532m). Wimpey reported a 19% rise in profits to Â£450.7m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected.\\n \\n Recent housing market surveys have indicated that the UK property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth. Last week, figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) indicated that the popularity of buy-to-let mortgages - a key phenomenon of the housing boom - could be waning.\\n \\n But B&B - which has a 22% share of the UK buy-to-let mortgage market - said that while rates of growth were moderating, the sector \"continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market\". Overall, B&B said that \"housing market fundamentals remain strong\". \"Interest rates and unemployment are both likely to remain at historically low levels, real household incomes should continue to grow and housing demand is likely to outstrip supply into the medium-term.\" Despite the upbeat tone, shares in B&B were down more than 4% at 325.5p in morning trade as analysts worried over future earnings growth.\\n \\n Wimpey\\'s profit figures came in at the top of expectations, with the numbers helped by buoyant sales in the US offsetting a slight slowdown in the UK. Wimpey said the UK housing market had proved \"challenging\" last year. \"By late summer, the market in general had slowed sharply across the country and showed no real improvement during the autumn,\" it added. However, the first seven weeks of this year had produced promising signs, Wimpey said. \"Visitor levels and interest in this period have been encouraging and reservations have been at the stronger end of our expectations.\" Shares in Wimpey were up 6% at 458.5p in morning trade.\\n',\n",

His comments came as President George W Bush said the US backed Russian entry. But he said for Russia to make progress the government must \"renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law\". His comments come three days before he is due to meet President Vladimir Putin.\\n \\n Russia has been waiting for a decade to join the WTO and hopes to finally become a member by early 2006. A decision could be reached in December, when the WTO\\'s 148 current members gather for a summit in Hong Kong. That would allow an earliest date for membership of January 2006, if the Hong Kong summit gave its approval. While pinpointing several areas in which there are difficulties in the bilateral and multilateral work with Russia, the US said the meeting was \"much more efficient than we\\'ve seen for some time\". And Australia said it was \"one of the best (meetings) we can recall in terms of substance\". Mr Johannesson also said progress \"on the bilateral market access side is accelerating\". Sticking points to membership have included limits on foreign ownership in the telecommunications and life insurance businesses, as well as issues surrounding counterfeiting, piracy, and data protection. Some WTO members also dislike Russia\\'s energy price subsidies, which competitors say give Russian businesses an unfair advantage.\\n',\n",

Mr Glazer got permission to look at the club\\'s accounts last week. Irish billionaires Mr McManus and Mr Magnier are said to believe that an Â£800m bid undervalues club prospects.\\n \\n Mr Magnier and Mr McManus, who hold their stake through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle have the power to block a bid. Mr Glazer\\'s financial backers, including JP Morgan, the US investment bank have said they won\\'t back a bid unless it receives backing from the owners of at least 75% of the club\\'s shares. However, there has been much speculation that the Irish duo simply do not think the price offered - 300p a share - is high enough. Mr Glazer has been stalking the premier league football club since 2003.\\n \\n Mr Magnier and Mr McManus issued a statement late on Friday saying that they remained \"long-term investors\" in Man Utd. The Sunday Telegraph says the board of Manchester United also considered a management buyout at just over 300p but did not go ahead with it.\\n',\n",
       " 'Dollar drops on reserves concerns\\n \\n The US dollar has dropped against major currencies on concerns that central banks may cut the amount of dollars they hold in their foreign reserves.\\n \\n Comments by South Korea\\'s central bank at the end of last week have sparked the recent round of dollar declines. South Korea, which has about $200bn in foreign reserves, said it plans instead to boost holdings of currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollar. Analysts reckon that other nations may follow suit and now ditch the dollar. At 1300 GMT, the euro was up 0.9% on the day at 1.3187 euros per US dollar. The British pound had added 0.5% to break through the $1.90 level, while the dollar had fallen by 1.3% against the Japanese yen to trade at 104.16 yen.\\n \\n At the start of the year, the US currency, which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows, staged something of a recovery.\\n \\n Analysts, however, pointed to the dollar\\'s inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data, and highlighted the fact that many of the US\\'s economic problems had not disappeared. The focus once again has been on the country\\'s massive trade and budget deficits, with predictions of more dollar weakness to come. \"The comments from Korea came at a time when sentiment towards the dollar was already softening,\" said Ian Gunner, a trader at Mellon Financial. On Tuesday, traders in Asia said that both South Korea and Taiwan had withdrawn their bids to buy dollars at the start of the session. Mansoor Mohi-Uddin, chief currency strategist at UBS, said that there was a sentiment in the market that \"central banks from Asia and the Middle East are buying euros\". A report last month already showed that the dollar was losing its allure as a currency that offered rock-steady returns and stability. Compiled by Central Banking Publications and sponsored by the UK\\'s Royal Bank of Scotland, the survey found 39 nations out of 65 questioned were increasing their euro holdings, with 29 cutting back on the US dollar.\\n',\n",
       " 'India and Russia in energy talks\\n \\n India and Russia are to work together in a series of energy deals, part of a pact which could see India invest up to $20bn in oil and gas projects.\\n \\n On the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals, to be led by Russian energy giant Gazprom and India\\'s ONGC. The Indian firm is also expected to hold talks on Tuesday about buying a stake in assets once owned by Yukos. It is reported to be keen on buying a 15% stake in oil unit Yuganskneftegas. The former Yukos subsidiary was controversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by state-owned energy giant Rosneft.\\n \\n Russian media reported that India and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation on Tuesday during a meeting between Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha, Gazprom chairman Aleksey Miller and India\\'s petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar.\\n \\n The agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining facilities in Russia, India and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil, gas and petrochemicals from Russia to India and other countries across Asia. ONGC could invest in gas and oil fields in Sakhalin, in the far east of Russia, and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern Siberia and the Caspian Sea.\\n \\n India is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies - particularly liquefied natural gas - as domestic demand is growing at more than 5% a year.\\n \\n ONGC\\'s Mr Raha said the two could work together on joint bids from next year. \"At current oil and gas prices, our cash flow situation is good,\" he told Reuters. \"What we are saying is - Gazprom has a huge amount of gas and we have the money. \"The investment may go up to $20bn or more for a period of five years or so.\"\\n \\n Russian news agencies reported that India\\'s petroleum minister Mr Aiyar and Russian energy minister Viktor Khristenko would discuss the future of Yugansk at a meeting on Tuesday. ONGC\\'s Mr Raha declined to be drawn on his firm\\'s reported interest in the company. However, he stressed that ONGC was not interested in a \\'loan-for-oil deal\\' in connection to Yugansk, similar to that concluded recently between Rosneft and China\\'s National Petroleum Corporation. \"China\\'s problem is it has immediate demand and they needed the oil for their coastal refineries. We do not. We would like long-term security through equity participation.\" It is thought that any decision over Yugansk will be delayed until a US court has decided whether to grant Yukos bankruptcy protection. Yukos is suing a host of companies involved in the sale of Yugansk, auctioned off to pay a huge back-tax bill. It has also threatened legal action against any business which has future commercial dealings with its former subsidiary.\\n',\n",
       " 'Weak data buffets French economy\\n \\n A batch of downbeat government data has cast doubt over the French economy\\'s future prospects.\\n \\n Official figures showed on Friday that unemployment was unchanged at 9.9% last month, while consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in October. At the same time, finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed a threat to French growth. \"[Oil prices] will weigh on consumer spending in the short term, and potentially on confidence,\" he said. World oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand.\\n \\n Analysts said French companies, keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff. \"[The unemployment figures] show the main problem of the French economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment,\" said Marc Touati, an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires. \"Politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms, otherwise in five or ten years, it will be too late.\" Obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in France than in many other European economies. Many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs, and by scrapping restrictions on working hours. The French statistics agency, INSEE, expects the economy to grow by about 2.4% this year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment. That is above the projected eurozone average of just above 2%.\\n',\n",
       " 'Business fears over sluggish EU economy\\n \\n As European leaders gather in Rome on Friday to sign the new EU constitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business.\\n \\n Lille is a popular tourist destination for Britons who want a taste of France at the weekend. But how many tourists look at the impressively grand Victorian Chambre de Commerce, which stands beside the Opera House, and consider that it was built - like the town halls in many northern English towns - on the wealth created by coal, steel and textiles? Like northern England and industrial Scotland, those industries have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990. Beck-Crespel is a specialist steel firm in Armentieres, about 20 miles from Lille. The company has not laid off a worker since 1945. It specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many of those are being built in Europe these days.\\n \\n Director Hugues Charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the Far East are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while his key markets are now in China and India. \"In our business the market is absolutely global, you can not imagine living with our size (of business) even within an enlarged European Union, (if we did that) we would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200,\" he says. It isn\\'t just globalisation that is hurting; the law in France means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours. But at least there is still a steel industry. Coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling. New business has been attracted, but not enough to make up the difference.\\n \\n That is one reason why people here are not great fans of the EU, says Frederic Sawicki, a politics lecturer at the University of Lille.\\n \\n \"In the region today the unemployment rate is 12%, in some areas it is 15%. They don\\'t see what Europe is doing for them, so there is a kind of euro scepticism, especially in the working classes,\" he says. Which is strange because Lille is at the crossroads of Europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here. The euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world. Much of that trade passes through the world\\'s largest port, Rotterdam, in Holland, home to specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec. Its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken Russian submarine Kursk from the sea bed, but Huisman Itrec is now setting up a factory in China, where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer.\\n \\n Boss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of orders closer to home. \"In the US growth is something like 6%, in China they are estimating 15%, and in the EU it is more or less 1%,\" he says. Mr Addink blames the euro for stifling demand. He much preferred the old currencies of Europe, which moved in relation to each country\\'s economic performance. In Germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. Growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2%. In Britain that would be a bad year; in Germany it is one of the best in recent years. With Germany making up a third of the eurozone\\'s economy, this is a major problem. If Germany doesn\\'t once again become the powerhouse of Europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be. However, at one factory near the Dutch border things are changing.\\n \\n The Siemens plant at Boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2,000 staff. Staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay, after Siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to Hungary. Factory manager Herbert Stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity \"by nearly 30%\". But Germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China. The Government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers, says Helmut Schneider, director of the Institute for the Study of Labour at Bonn University. \"Labour is too costly in Germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. If we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half,\" he says. The EU set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010. Four years into that process, and the target seems further away than ever.\\n',\n",

Separately, investment bank Goldman Sachs produced reseach showing that a basket of 35 M&S goods is now 11% above the high-street average, compared with 43% higher last year.\\n \\n It has been a strange week for M&S, which on Tuesday received a statement from Philip Green, the billionaire Bhs owner, confirming he was not rebidding for the company. This was followed the same day by Mark Paulsmeier, a South African financier, issuing a press release saying his Paulsmeier Group was interested in M&S. A sudden spike in M&S\\'s share price followed. However, an M&S spokesman said on Sunday it had no evidence that Mr Paulsmeier had lined up sufficient finance for a bid. He also said the Takeover Panel and the UK\\'s financial watchdog the Financial Services Authority had been in touch with M&S at the beginning of the week to find out what it knew about the Paulsmeier developments.\\n',\n",

Senate sources say the missing tapes may have been stolen from a plane by baggage handlers. The bank gave no details of how the records disappeared, but said they had probably not been misused. Customers\\' accounts were being monitoring and account holders would be notified if any \"unusual activity\" was detected, bank officials said.\\n \\n Bank of America said the tapes went missing in December while being shipped to a back-up data centre. \"We, with federal law authorities, have done a very robust, thorough investigation on this and neither we nor they would make the statement lightly that we believe those tapes to be lost,\" Alexandra Tower, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina-based bank, told Time magazine. But although there was no evidence of criminal activity, the bank said, the Secret Service - a federal agency whose brief includes investigations of serious financial crime - is said to be looking into the loss. New York Senator Charles Schumer said he was told by the Senate Rules Committee that the tapes were probably stolen from a commercial plane. \"Whether it is identity theft, terrorism, or other theft, in this new complicated world baggage handlers should have background checks and more care should be taken for who is hired for these increasingly sensitive positions,\" the Democrat senator said.

Jet Airways, a low-fare airline, was founded by London-based ex-travel agent Naresh Goya, and controls 45% of the Indian domestic airline market. It sold 20% of its equity or 17.2 million shares in a bid to raise up to $443m (Â£230.8m).

India began to open up its domestic airline market - previously dominated by state-run carrier Indian Airlines - in the 1990s. Jet began flying in 1993 and now has competitors including Air Deccan and Air Sahara. Budget carriers Kingfisher Airlines and SpiceJet are planning to launch operations in May this year. Jet has 42 aircraft and runs 271 scheduled flights daily within India. It recently won government permission to fly to London, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.\\n',\n",

The bank had been accused of illegally concealing Gen Pinochet\\'s assets. More than 3,000 people were killed for political reasons under Gen Pinochet\\'s regime, an official report says. Last month in a US court, Riggs Bank pleaded guilty to failing to report suspicious activity relating to accounts held by Gen Pinochet and the government of Equatorial Guinea. On that occasion, it was ordered to pay a fine of $16m. Gen Pinochet himself has never been put on trial for human rights violations under his 1973-90 rule, despite several high-profile cases against him. He is now facing charges relating to the murder of one Chilean and the disappearance of nine others. He is also being investigated for tax evasion, tax fraud and embezzlement of state funds.\\n \\n The general\\'s opponents rejoiced at the settlement, which was agreed in a court in the Spanish capital, Madrid. A lawyer for the victims, Eduardo Contreras, told Reuters news agency: \"This demonstrates that the horrors of the Pinochet dictatorship are not a mystery to anyone and that the whole world knows his victims deserve reparations.\" Riggs spokesman Mark Hendrix said the settlement, details of which will be announced next week, was an opportunity to move on. \"This enables the institution to put the matter behind us,\" he told Reuters. The settlement follows a legal complaint filed against the bank by Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon alleging that it had illegally concealed assets. The bank agreed to create a fund for the victims, but the charges were dropped.\\n',\n",

Qwest chairman Richard Notebaert sent a letter to MCI\\'s board on Thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining Verizon\\'s bid. Formerly known as Worldcom, MCI is a long-distance and corporate phone firm. Snapping up MCI would give the buyer access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. Shares of MCI were up more than 4% in electronic trading after the close of New York markets.\\n \\n Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. \"We would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the Verizon merger agreement, we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire MCI,\" the letter from Qwest said. Verizon\\'s offer is made up of cash, shares and dividends, and a number of investors have said that it undervalues MCI. Verizon plans to swap 0.41 of its shares and $1.50 in cash for each MCI share, as well as offering special dividends of $4.50 a share. Both company boards have backed the deal, but regulators will still need to give their approval. As well as trying to lure investors with the promise of better returns, Qwest also reckons that its offer will face less regulatory scrutiny than Verizon\\'s.\\n \\n The takeover would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. There may be concerns other than cash, however, especially as MCI only emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. Verizon is far bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Also, MCI, while trading under the name Worldcom, became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in US history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently standing trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest, meanwhile, had to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it massaged earnings to keep Wall Street happy.\\n',\n",
       " 'Fiat chief takes steering wheel\\n \\n The chief executive of the Fiat conglomerate has taken day-to-day control of its struggling car business in an effort to turn it around.\\n \\n Sergio Marchionne has replaced Herbert Demel as chief executive of Fiat Auto, with Mr Demel leaving the company. Mr Marchionne becomes the fourth head of the business - which is expected to make a 800m euro ($1bn) loss in 2004 - in as many years. Fiat underperformed the market in Europe last year, seeing flat sales.\\n \\n The car business has made an operating loss in five of the last six years and was forced to push back its break-even target from 2005 to 2006. The management changes are part of a wider shake-up of the business following Fiat\\'s resolution of its dispute with General Motors. As part of a major restructuring, Fiat is to integrate the Maserati car company - currently owned by Ferrari - within its own operations. Ferrari, in which Fiat owns a majority stake, could be separately floated on the stock market in either 2006 or 2007.\\n \\n Mr Marchionne, who only joined the company last year, said Fiat Auto was now the \"principal focus\" of his attention. \"I have made the decision to take on the post of chief executive of the auto unit to speed up the company\\'s recovery,\" he said. \"A profound cultural transformation is underway following a management reorganisation that has delivered a more agile and efficient structure,\" he added.\\n \\n Although Mr Marchionne does not have a background in the car industry, he has been playing an increasing role in the group\\'s activities. Last year, he said that a series of new models, launched as part of the group\\'s recovery plan, had not boosted revenues as much as hoped. The car business, best known for its Alfa Romeo marque, is expected to make a loss of about 800m euros in 2004. Sales are expected to fall in 2005, Fiat said this week, as it exits unprofitable areas such as the rental car market. Mr Demel, a car industry veteran, took the helm in November 2003 after being recruited by former Fiat chief executive Giuseppe Morchio. Mr Morchio made a bid last year to become chairman after the death of president Umberto Agnelli. However, this was rejected by the founding Agnelli family and Mr Morchio subsequently resigned. Earlier this week, Fiat reached an agreement with GM to dissolve an alliance which could have obliged GM to buy the Italian firm outright. GM will pay Fiat $2bn as part of the settlement.\\n',\n",
       " 'Consumers drive French economy\\n \\n France\\'s economic growth accelerated in the last three months of 2004, driven by consumer spending, a report shows.\\n \\n Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.8% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three month period, the statistical office INSEE said. That expansion pushed annual growth to 2.3%, the fastest rate in two years. Consumer spending was up by 1.2% in the fourth quarter, and there also was a rebound in business investment that gave the recovery an extra shove.\\n \\n Analysts warned that France still was facing challenges and was unlikely to keep expanding at its current pace.\\n \\n \"France still has a strong economic growth,\" said Marc Toutai, an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires. \"But, if we check the figures in detail, there\\'s a problem.\" \"Consumer spending is still high. But French households have spent their savings to consume. \"France can\\'t sustain a high growth rate without an improvement in the job market. There\\'s too much of a gap between growth and employment.\" Unemployment levels are currently stuck at about 10%, and is proving difficult to bring down despite government efforts. Another worry is that demand in Germany and Italy, two of France\\'s main trading partners, is sluggish.\\n \\n Despite the concerns, analysts pointed out that France was outperforming the majority of its European counterparts and that its economy was looking more robust than in previous years. As well as strong domestic demand, exports climbed by 1.3% in the fourth quarter - the biggest increase in foreign sales for a year. \"It\\'s an economic growth that seems well balanced,\" said Nicolas Claquin, an analyst at CCF. \"In the beginning of 2004, growth was mainly driven by consumer spending. Here it gets contributions from investment and exports, though household consumption is still strong. \"But we expect overall economic growth to fall to 2.0 percent in 2005.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'US regulator to rule on pain drug\\n \\n US food and drug regulators will decide on Friday whether to recommend the sale of painkillers that have been linked to a high risk of heart attack and stroke.\\n \\n The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel will give its verdict after hearing evidence for three days. The painkillers - called COX-2 inhibitors - are sold under brand names such as Celebrex and Vioxx. Vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but Merck said it would consider selling it if it gets FDA approval. The FDA has been asked to decide if the benefits to patients justify the increased risks.\\n \\n Putting Vioxx back on the shelves is likely to boost profits at Merck and make easier any legal battles with people who claim to have been injured by the drug, analysts said.\\n \\n Merck voluntarily stopped sales of Vioxx on 30 September, a move which caused the firm\\'s fourth-quarter earnings to slide to $1.1bn (Â£581m), from $1.4bn a year earlier. Merck\\'s shares tumbled more than 10% on the news and the company has had to set aside millions of dollars to cover the cost of Vioxx-related litigation. Alarm bells were rung by a research note called Approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least 18 months. The Cox-2 inhibitors were developed by drug companies, including Merck and Pfizer, because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers.\\n \\n Pfizer is still selling its Celebrex and Bextra products, though investigations have suggested that they may also be harmful to the heart. Merck\\'s announcement of a possible reintroduction of Vioxx caught analysts by surprise. Merck\\'s head of research Peter Kim said that it withdrew Vioxx \"based on the information that was available to us at the time, knowing there were alternative therapies\". He went on to say that things have since changed in the light of new reports. \"Given this new information, its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in Approve makes Vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the US,\" Mr Kim explained.\\n \\n On Thursday, David Graham from the FDA\\'s Office of Drug Safety told the advisory panel that \"there really doesn\\'t appear to be a need for Cox-2\" inhibitors. According to calculations presented to the US Senate by Dr Graham in November, Vioxx may be linked to as many as to 56,000 American deaths. Facing stem criticism for its handling of the Vioxx case, the FDA said on Tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place. European regulators, meanwhile, ruled on Thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take Cox-2 inhibitors. The European Medicines Agency also said doctors should be \"cautious\" about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'Yukos bankruptcy \\'not US matter\\'\\n \\n Russian authorities do not have to abide by any US court decisions taken with regard to troubled oil giant Yukos, a Houston court has been told.\\n \\n Legal expert William Butler said there was no treaty between the US and Russia to recognise the other\\'s legal rulings. That meant Moscow would not have to adhere to US rulings in the Yukos case. Yukos says a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has a US subsidiary and local bank accounts.\\n \\n Yukos made its surprise Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in Houston in December in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of Yugansk, its main oil producing unit, by Russian authorities. Yugansk was sold to help pay off a $27.5bn (Â£14.5bn) back tax bill. It was bought for $9.4bn by a previously unknown group, which was in turn bought by state-controlled oil company Rosneft. The US court\\'s jurisdiction has been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft. Deutsche Bank maintains the case has no place in a US court because Yukos has no assets in the US, apart from two bank accounts and a house in Houston owned by its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore. Deutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos. It had agreed to loan Gazpromneft the money to bid for Yugansk. US bankruptcy judge Letitia Clark, who issued an injunction in December to try and prevent the Yugansk sale, has said she will rule \"pretty promptly, however I do not anticipate ruling on it before next Tuesday\".\\n \\n Yukos has claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. It has claimed that Russia imposed the huge tax bill and forced the sale of Yugansk as part of a campaign to destroy Yukos and its former owner Mihkail Khodorkovsky, who is facing a 10-year prison term in Russia for fraud and tax evasion. Yukos\\' parent company, the Gibraltar-based Menatep Group, is suing Russia in Europe for $28.3bn in financial damages. The company is also seeking $20bn in a separate US lawsuit against Rosneft and Gazprom for their role in the sale of Yugansk.\\n',\n",

Borussia Dortmund has posted record losses and missed rent payments on its Westfallen stadium. Chief executive Gerd Niebaum stepped down last week and creditors are now pushing for greater control. Shares in Borussia Dortmund, Germany\\'s only stock-market listed football club, dropped by almost 23% to 2.05 euros during early afternoon trading.\\n \\n Fund manager Florian Hamm - Borussia Dortmund\\'s largest investor - said he would only invest more money in the company if he got a greater say in how it is run. \"I demand better transparency,\" he is quoted as saying by Germany\\'s Manger Magazin. The club has also faced calls to appoint executives from outside the club.\\n \\n Borussia Dortmund posted a record loss of 68m euros ($89m; Â£47m) in the 12 months through June. It made a loss of 27.2m euros in the first half of the current fiscal year and said that total debts will increase to 134.7m euros by the middle of 2006 unless a restructuring plan is pushed through. \"This is the bill for their mismanagement over the past years,\" said HVB analyst Peter-Thilo Halser. The club appointed an auditor, who has recommended a number of steps, including deferring the rent due on the stadium and suspending debt repayments until at least the 2006-2007 fiscal year. Stephen Schechter, a UK investment banker who has held talks with Borussia Dortmund over a possible bond sale, said the club needs a capital injection of 35m euros. \"They need strong people on the board who do not have a history with the club,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " '\\'Post-Christmas lull\\' in lending\\n \\n UK mortgage lending showed a \"post-Christmas lull\" in January, indicating a slowing housing market, lenders have said.\\n \\n Both the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) and Building Society Association (BSA) said lending was down sharply. The CML said gross mortgage lending stood at Â£17.9bn, compared with Â£21.8bn in January last year. The BSA said mortgage approvals - loans approved but not yet made - were Â£2bn, down from Â£2.6bn in January 2004.\\n \\n At the same time, the British Bankers\\' Association (BBA) said lending was \"weaker\". Overall, the BBA said mortgage lending rose by Â£4bn in January, a far smaller increase than the Â£5.1bn seen in December. This was a return to the \"weaker pattern\" of lending seen in the last months of 2004, the BBA added. However, it is the year-on-year lending comparisons which are the most striking. The CML said lending for house purchases and gross mortgage lending were 29% and 18% lower year-on-year respectively. \"These figures show beyond doubt the recent slowdown in the housing market,\" Peter Williams, CML deputy director, said.\\n',\n",
       " 'UK \\'risks breaking golden rule\\'\\n \\n The UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its \"golden rule\", a report suggests.\\n \\n The rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest, and not to finance its spending projects. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) claims that taxes need to rise by about Â£10bn if state finances are to be put in order. The Treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008. According to NIESR, if the government\\'s current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is \"unlikely\" the golden rule will be met. Should the cycle end a year earlier, then the chances improve to \"50/50\". Either way, fiscal tightening is needed, NIESR said.\\n \\n The report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections. Earlier this month, accountancy firm Ernst & Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown\\'s forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic.\\n \\n It claimed revenues were likely to be Â£6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. A Treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying it was \"on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond\". \"Spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable.\" Other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy.\\n \\n It said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion, saying that if anything the \"world economy will continue to grow strongly\". Global gross domestic product (GDP) is tipped to be 4.1% this year, dipping to 4% in 2005, before picking up again to 4.2% in 2006. The US will continue to drive expansion until 2006, albeit at a slightly slower rate, as will be the case in Japan. Hinting at better times for UK exporters, NIESR said the euro zone \"is expected to pick up speed\".\\n \\n Growth in Britain also is set to accelerate, it forecast. \"Despite weak growth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006,\" NIESR said, adding that \"the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery\". GDP is expected at 3.2% in 2004, and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006. The main cloud on the horizon, NIESR said, was the UK\\'s much analysed and fretted over property market.\\n',\n",

Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom\\'s collapse in 2002. He pleads not guilty. Mr Sullivan has spent two days being cross-examined by lawyers for former Worldcom chief executive Mr Ebbers.\\n \\n Attorney Reid Weingarten has attempted to portray Mr Sullivan as a liar and on Thursday quizzed him about his decision to commit fraud to meet analysts\\' profit estimates. \"At that point in time,\" Mr Sullivan said, referring to the first false entries in late 2000, \"I knew it was wrong and I knew it was against the law, but I thought we would get through it in the short term.\" Mr Sullivan, 42, has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following Mr Ebbers\\' trial, where he is appearing as a prosecution witness. Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom\\'s finances. The former finance officer said Mr Ebbers knew about the improper accounting entries that were made between 2000 and 2002 to conceal soaring expenses and inflate revenue.\\n \\n Mr Ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. WorldCom\\'s problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies. Prosecutors allege that the company\\'s top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period. WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as MCI.

President Viktor Yushchenko, elected in December, is planning to revisit many of Ukraine's recent privatisations. Krivorizhstal is one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous administration.\\n \\n On Wednesday, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed.\\n \\n Mr Yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to 30-40 enterprises. More than 90,000 businesses in all, from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts, have been sold off since 1992, as the command economy built up when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union was dismantled. Analysts have suggested that the government needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list, so as to preserve investor confidence.\\n \\n Thursday's ruling by a district court in Perchesk overturned a previous decision in a lower court permitting the sale. The consortium which won the auction for the mill was created by Viktor Pinchuk, son-in-law of former-President Leonid Kuchma, and Rinat Akhmetov, the country's richest man. The next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether, opening the way for Krivorizhstal to be resold. Mr Yushchenko has suggested a fair valuation could be as much as $3bn. One of the foreign bidders who lost out, steel giant LNM, told BBC News that it would be interested in any renewed sale.\\n\",\n",

The company also said it now believed the development area would be able to produce oil for more than 25 years. Cairn\\'s share price rose 300% last year after a number of oil finds, but its shares were hit in December following a disappointing drilling update. December\\'s share fall means that Cairn is still in danger of being relegated from the FTSE 100 when the index is reshuffled next month. Cairn\\'s shares closed up 64 pence, or 6%, at 1130p on Thursday.\\n \\n Before Christmas, Cairn revealed that drilling to the north of the field in Rajasthan had been disappointing, which caused its shares to lose 18% in one day.\\n \\n However, on Thursday, the group said its belief that the path of oil in the area actually moved further to the west had proved correct. \"This area does need more appraisal drilling but it looks very strong,\" Dr Mike Watts head of exploration said. Chief executive Bill Gammell added: \"The more we progress in Rajasthan the better we feel about it.\" Cairn made the discovery after having been granted an extension to their drilling licence in January by Indian authorities. The firm has applied for a 30-month extension to scout for oil outside its main development area, which includes the Mangala and Aishwariya fields where Cairn has previously announced major discoveries. It also said production at its other fields across the globe was likely to surpass levels seen in 2004.\\n',\n",

The measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost Georgia\\'s flagging economy. Georgia\\'s black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy.\\n \\n Mr Saakashvili, elected president in January after Mr Shevardnadze was toppled, has urged the Georgian Parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible. It is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption, which was rampant during the Shevardnadze era, and boost Georgia\\'s fragile public finances.\\n \\n The new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 January, three days before President Saakashvili was elected. \"There are people who have money but are afraid to show it,\" the president told a government session. \"Documentation about where this money came from doesn\\'t exist because under the former, entirely warped regime, earning capital honestly was not possible.\"\\n \\n By declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax, people would be able to \"legalise their property\", Mr Saakashvili stressed.\\n \\n \"No one will have the right to check this money\\'s origin. This money must go back into the economy.\" The amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering. Criminal investigations in such cases -thought to involve about 5% of Georgian businesses -are to continue. Mr Saakashvili has accused the Shevardnadze regime, which was toppled by a popular uprising in November, of allowing bribery to flourish. Georgia\\'s economy is in a desperate condition. Half the population are living below the poverty line with many surviving on income of less than $4, or three euros, a day.

       " 'Cuba winds back economic clock\\n \\n Fidel Castro\\'s decision to ban all cash transactions in US dollars in Cuba has once more turned the spotlight on Cuba\\'s ailing economy.\\n \\n All conversions between the US dollar and Cuba\\'s \"convertible\" peso will from 8 November be subject to a 10% tax. Cuban citizens, who receive money from overseas, and foreign visitors, who change dollars in Cuba, will be affected. Critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards, reflecting the Cuban president\\'s desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise. In a live television broadcast announcing the measure, President Castro\\'s chief aide said it was necessary because of the United States\\' increasing \"economic aggression\". \"The ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the US government to suffocate our country,\" he said.\\n \\n The Bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on Cuba in recent months. President Bush\\'s government, which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade embargo on Cuba, introduced even tighter restrictions on Cuba in May.\\n \\n Cubans living in the US are now limited to one visit to Cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives. A leading expert on the Cuban economy says that Castro\\'s tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture. \"I think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash,\" says Jose Barrionuevo, head of strategy for Latin American emerging markets for Barclays Capital. \"It underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue.\"\\n \\n The tax will hit the families of Cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home. This money, known as remittances, can amount to as much as $1bn a year. Those remaining in Cuba will have to pay the tax. Their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax, such as euros, or increase their dollar payments to compensate. However, many of Cuban\\'s poorest citizens could be worse off as a result. The tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit Cuba every year, particularly those Americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there.\\n \\n Cuba\\'s tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and, according to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, is now worth $3bn to the country.\\n \\n The tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for Cuba\\'s cash-strapped economy. Cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food, fuel and medicine. Much of Cuba\\'s basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. In recent weeks, Cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island. Cuba\\'s economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid 1990s as the collapse of the Soviet Union forced it to embrace foreign capital, decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise. However, a decline in foreign tourism since 2002, periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy. It has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government\\'s economic problems. The tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading, Mr Barrionuevo said. \"The main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries, like Venezuela, which have restrictions on capital,\" he says. Mr Barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity. \"It is intended to be a permanent measure but I am not sure it can last too long.\"\\n',\n",

Novartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about $200m a year following the acquisitions. Novartis\\' shares rose 1% to 57.85 Swiss francs in early trading.\\n \\n The deal will see Novartis\\' Sandoz business overtake Israel\\'s Teva Pharmaceuticals as the world\\'s biggest maker of generics.

Novartis said that it would merge a number of departments, adding that there may be job cuts.\\n \\n \"The strong growth outlook for Sandoz, which will create jobs, is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force,\" the firm said in a statement. Generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals.

MCI\\'s directors have backed Verizon, despite it tabling less money. They are accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by depriving MCI shareholders \"of maximum value\".\\n \\n According the legal papers filed in a Delaware court, Verizon is set to pay an \"\"unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate\" sum for MCI, which was formerly known as Worldcom. Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. A number of large MCI shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that Verizon\\'s offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company. Friday\\'s lawsuit argues that the Verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the US phone industry will put a premium on MCI\\'s network, assets and clients. MCI\\'s directors have argued that Verizon is bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Chief executive Michael Capellas spent last week meeting with shareholders in an effort to win their backing.\\n \\n In 2002, investors in the then-named Worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal. However, the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. It is a long-distance and corporate phone firm, and would provide the buyer with access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. MCI shares jumped on Friday, hitting their highest level since April 2004 amid speculation that it would be the focus of a bidding war. A takeover of MCI would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone pioneer AT&T for about $16bn.\\n',\n",

But Deutsche Boerse told news agency Reuters such a move would have to wait until May\\'s annual general meeting. Investors want Deutsche to return cash to shareholders rather than bid. \"We are long-term investors and are experienced in removing management.

The group owns more than 5% of Deutsche - more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the German exchange\\'s management. Under German law Deutsche does not need investor backing to make a takeover bid. TCI and Atticus have opposed the LSE bid for some time saying it would destroy shareholder value, and would be better spent on a share buyback. Deutsche is in competition with pan-European bourse Euronext to take over the London exchange. Many commentators have suggested a bidding war between the two could break out. However, any such move would have to wait until March when the Office of Fair Trading completes an investigation into the competition aspects of the pair\\'s takeover proposals.\\n',\n",
       " 'Bush to outline \\'toughest\\' budget\\n \\n President Bush is to send his toughest budget proposals to date to the US Congress, seeking large cuts in domestic spending to lower the deficit.\\n \\n About 150 federal programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of a $2.5 trillion (Â£1.3 trillion) package aimed at curbing the giant US budget deficit. Defence spending will rise, however, while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in Iraq. Vice-President Dick Cheney said the budget was the \"tightest\" so far.\\n \\n At the heart of the administration\\'s fifth budget, presented to Congress on Monday, is an austere package of domestic measures. These would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation.\\n \\n Such belt-tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of President Bush\\'s first term. Mr Cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the Bush Presidency but argued it was \"fair and responsible\". \"It is not something we have done with a meat axe, nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society,\" he said. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, increased expenditure on national security after 9/11 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by President Bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit. The shortfall is projected to rise to $427bn in 2005.\\n \\n Education, environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as a first step towards reducing the deficit to $230bn by 2009.\\n \\n Most controversially, the government is seeking to cut the Medicaid budget, which provides health care to the nation\\'s poorest, by $45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by $587m. Spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase, although not by as much as originally planned. President Bush\\'s proposals would see the Pentagon\\'s budget rise by $19bn to $419.3bn while homeland security would get an extra $2bn.\\n \\n The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration in expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.\\n \\n Also not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administration\\'s radical proposed overhaul of social security provision. Some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5bn trillion over a twenty year period. Despite the Republicans holding a majority in both houses of Congress, the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months.\\n \\n John McCain, a Republican Senator, said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit. \"With the deficits that we are now running, I am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget,\" he said. However, Democratic Senator Kent Conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond 2009. \"The cost of everything he [President Bush] advocates explodes,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Orange colour clash set for court\\n \\n A row over the colour orange could hit the courts after mobile phone giant Orange launched action against a new mobile venture from Easyjet\\'s founder.\\n \\n Orange said it was starting proceedings against the Easymobile service for trademark infringement. Easymobile uses Easygroup\\'s orange branding. Founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou has pledged to contest the action. The move comes after the two sides failed to come to an agreement after six months of talks. Orange claims the new low-cost mobile service has infringed its rights regarding the use of the colour orange and could confuse customers - known as \"passing off\".\\n \\n \"Our brand, and the rights associated with it are extremely important to us,\" Orange said in a statement. \"In the absence of any firm commitment from Easy, we have been left with no choice but to start an action for trademark infringement and passing off.\" However, Mr Haji-Ioannou, who plans to launch Easymobile next month, vowed to fight back, saying: \"We have nothing to be afraid of in this court case. \"It is our right to use our own corporate colour for which we have become famous during the last 10 years.\" The Easyjet founder also said he planned to add a disclaimer to the Easygroup website to ensure customers are aware the Easymobile brand has no connection to Orange. The new service is the latest venture from Easygroup, which includes a chain of internet cafes, budget car rentals and an intercity bus service. Easymobile will allow customers to go online to order SIM cards and airtime - which will be rented from T-Mobile - for their existing handsets.\\n',\n",
       " 'Standard Life cuts policy bonuses\\n \\n Standard Life, Europe\\'s largest mutual life insurer, has cut bonuses for with-profit policyholders.\\n \\n Annual bonus rates on its with-profits life policies were cut from 2.5% to 2%, while bonuses on pension policies were reduced from 3.25% to 2.5%. It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004. The insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates.\\n \\n With-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. Profits made in good years are kept in reserve to pay investors an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly. Slumping share prices throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. Standard Life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002. The insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered. Recently, Norwich Union and Axa Sun Life both cut their with-profit bonus rates.\\n \\n John Gill, managing director of the insurer\\'s life and pensions division, said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only \"partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002\". In addition, low interest rates meant that \"long-term investment returns are well below historic levels\", Mr Gill added. However, Mr Gill maintained that with-profits continued to perform well over the long term. \"Our payouts continue to stand up well against other types of long-term investments over similar periods,\" he said. Standard Life has an estimated 2.4 million with-profits policyholders. Last year, the company announced that it was looking to float on the stock market in 2006.\\n',\n",
       " 'EMI shares hit by profit warning\\n \\n Shares in music giant EMI have sunk by more than 16% after the firm issued a profit warning following disappointing sales and delays to two album releases.\\n \\n EMI said music sales for the year to March will fall 8-9% from the year before, with profits set to be 15% lower than analysts had expected. It blamed poor sales since Christmas and delays to the releases of new albums by Coldplay and Gorillaz. By 1200 GMT on Monday, EMI shares were down 16.2% at 235.75 pence.\\n \\n EMI said two major albums scheduled for release before the end of the financial year in March - one by Coldplay and one by Gorillaz - have now had their release dates put back.\\n \\n \"EMI Music\\'s sales, particularly re-orders, in January have also been lower than anticipated and this is expected to continue through February and March,\" the company added. \"Therefore, for the full year, at constant currency, EMI Music\\'s sales are now expected to be 8% to 9% lower than the prior year.\" The company said it expected profits to be about Â£138m ($259.8m). Alain Levy, chairman and chief executive of EMI Music, described the performance as \"disappointing\", but added that he remained optimistic over future trends in the industry. \"The physical music market is showing signs of stabilisation in many parts of the world and digital music, in all its forms, continues to develop at a rapid pace,\" he said.\\n \\n Commenting on the delay to the release of the Coldplay and Gorillaz albums, Mr Levy said that \"creating and marketing music is not an exact science and cannot always coincide with our reporting periods\". \"While this rescheduling and recent softness is disappointing, it does not change my views of the improving health of the global recorded music industry,\" he added. Paul Richards, an analyst at Numis Securities, said the market would be focusing on the slump in music sales rather than the timing of the two albums. \"It\\'s unusual to see this much of a downgrade just because of phasing,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'China\\'s Shanda buys stake in Sina\\n \\n Chinese online game operator Shanda Interactive Entertainment has bought a 20% stake in Sina, the country\\'s biggest internet portal firm.\\n \\n The move may be a precursor to a full takeover, with analysts saying that a better-known international firm may also now show an interest in Sina. Shanda said that it may boost its stake in Sina, even buying it outright. A merger would create a firm that offers online role-playing games, news, entertainment and wireless messaging.\\n \\n Sina said that the purchase of a stake by Shanda would have no impact on its business.\\n \\n The board of directors said in a statement that it would \"continue to act in the best interests of all the company stakeholders, including shareholders, employees and customers\". Both companies are listed on the New York Stock Exchange\\'s (NYSE) technology-dominated Nasdaq index. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Sina said its shares were purchased between 12 January and 10 February for about $230m. Rumours about a possible takeover boosted Sina\\'s shares by more than 10% on Friday. They added an extra 6.4% to $27.24 in electronic trading after the trading session had finished. And there may be more gains amid bid speculation when trading resumes in New York on Tuesday after Monday\\'s public holiday, analysts forecast. \"There could still be some potential parties that could still counter bid,\" said Wallace Cheung, an analyst at DBS Vickers. \"Even though Shanda has 20% of Sina, they still have quite a long way to take full control.\" However, Mr Cheung noted that a foreign company trying to take control of a Chinese internet portal firm, with its ability to filter and pass on news, may not be viewed very favourably by Beijing.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mixed reaction to Man Utd offer\\n \\n Shares in Manchester United were up over 5% by noon on Monday following a new offer from Malcolm Glazer.\\n \\n The board of Man Utd is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal from the US tycoon that values the club at Â£800m ($1.5bn). Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer. A senior source at the club told the BBC: \"This time it\\'s different\". The board is obliged to consider this deal. But the Man Utd supporters club urged the club to reject the new deal. Manchester United past and present footballers Eric Cantona and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and club manager Sir Alex Ferguson, have lent their backing to the supporters\\' group, Shareholders United. They have all spoken out against the bid.\\n \\n A spokesman for the supporters club said: \"I can\\'t see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer\\'s previous proposals) other than Â£200m less debt. \"He isn\\'t bringing any money into the club; he\\'ll use our money to buy it.\"\\n \\n Mr Glazer\\'s latest move is being led by Mr Glazer\\'s two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times. A proposal was received by David Gill, United\\'s chief executive, at the end of last week, pitched at about 300p a share. David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a \"well funded\" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club. \"I do not think there is anything that Manchester United fans can do about it,\" he told the BBC. \"They can complain about it but it is curtains for them. They may not want him but they are going to get him.\" The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with \"detailed proposals\", it has confirmed.\\n \\n Mr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. He is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal, though it is not clear by how much. For his proposal to succeed, he needs the support of United\\'s largest shareholders, the Irish horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier. They own 29% of United through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle. Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid. NM Rothschild, the investment bank, is advising Mr Glazer, according to the Financial Times. His previous adviser, JPMorgan, quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board, against its advice. But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazer\\'s latest financial proposal.\\n',\n",
       " 'Gold falls on IMF sale concerns\\n \\n The price of gold has fallen after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief.\\n \\n By revaluing its holdings, the IMF may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the world\\'s poorest nations. The plan was put forward by G7 finance ministers over the weekend. The price of gold fell to $413.50 an ounce in Asia, before rebounding slightly in early European trading.\\n \\n IMF boss Rodrigo Rato was asked by G7 ministers to carry out a study into the feasibility of revaluing and selling gold reserves.\\n \\n He is expected to present his conclusions at an IMF meeting in Washington during April. \"Whatever happens the market is going to be disconcerted and on the back foot until the April IMF meetings,\" said John Reade, an analyst at UBS. The IMF values its gold reserves at between $40 and $50 an ounce, a price that was fixed in the 1970s and is about a tenth of the metal\\'s current market value. The IMF has 3,217 tonnes of gold, or about 113.5m ounces. Bringing the book price of the gold in line with market value would boost the IMF\\'s balance sheet, giving it more money to distribute.\\n \\n This idea has been put forward before, but there now seems to be a more committed political drive to address the issue of global poverty. \"This is the first time there has been a mention of the use of gold in a G7 communiqu&#233; for achieving debt relief,\" said UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. At their meeting in London, G7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts owed by some of the world\\'s poorest countries. Mr Brown said the meeting would be remembered as \"the 100% debt relief summit\". While debt relief seems to have jumped to the top of the global agenda, not everyone is convinced that selling IMF gold is the best way forward. The US, which can veto any plan to sell IMF gold should it so choose, said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem. \"The US is not convinced that\\'s the necessary way to do it,\" said Treasury Under Secretary John Taylor. Canada, a key gold producer, also expressed reservations.\\n',\n",

The two Japanese companies will collaborate in research & development, production, marketing and licensing. They said the agreement would enable the two companies to expand the plasma display TV market globally.\\n \\n Plasma display panels are used for large, thin TVs which are replacing old-style televisions. The display market for high-definition televisions is split between models using plasma display panels and others - manufactured by the likes of Sony and Samsung - using liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). The deal will enable Hitachi and Matsushita, which makes Panasonic brand products, to develop new technology and improve their competitiveness. Hitachi recently announced a deal to buy plasma display technology from rival Fujitsu in an effort to strengthen its presence in the market.\\n \\n Separately, Fujitsu announced on Monday that it is quitting the LCD panel market by transferring its operations in the area to Japanese manufacturer Sharp. Sharp will inherit staff, manufacturing facilities and intellectual property from Fujitsu. The plasma panel market has seen rapid consolidation in recent months as the price of consumer electronic goods and components has fallen. Samsung Electronics and Sony are among other companies working together to reduce costs and speed up new product development.\\n\",\n",

The proposed deal was seen as crucial to safeguarding the future of Rover's Longbridge plant in the West Midlands. However, there are growing fears that the deal could result in job losses. The Observer reported on Sunday that nearly half the workforce at Longbridge could be under threat if the deal goes ahead.\\n \\n Shanghai Automotive's proposed Â£1bn investment in Rover is awaiting approval by its owner, the Shanghai city government and by the National Development and Reform Commission, which oversees foreign investment by Chinese firms. According to the FT, the regulator has been annoyed by Rover's decision to talk publicly about the deal and the intense speculation which has ensued about what it will mean for Rover's future. As a result, hopes that approval of the deal may be fast-tracked have disappeared, the paper said. There has been continued speculation about the viability of Rover's Longbridge plant because of falling sales and unfashionable models.\\n \\n According to the Observer, 3,000 jobs - out of a total workforce of 6,500 - could be lost if the deal goes ahead. The paper said that Chinese officials believe cutbacks will be required to keep the MG Rover's costs in line with revenues. It also said that the production of new models through the joint venture would take at least eighteen months. Neither Rover nor Shanghai Automotive commented on the reports.\\n\",\n",
       " 'US bank boss hails \\'genius\\' Smith\\n \\n US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has given a speech at a Scottish church in honour of the pioneering economist, Adam Smith.\\n \\n He delivered the 14th Adam Smith Lecture in Kirkcaldy, Fife. The Adam Smith Lecture celebrates the author of 1776\\'s Wealth of Nations, which became a bible of capitalism. Dr Greenspan was invited by Chancellor Gordon Brown, whose minister father John used to preach at the St Bryce Kirk church. Mr Brown introduced Dr Greenspan to the 400 invited guests as the \"the world\\'s greatest economist\". Dr Greenspan, 79, who has been in the UK to attend the G7 meeting in London, said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to Smith, whose genius he compared to that of Mozart.\\n \\n He said the philosopher was a \"towering contributor to the modern world\". \"Kirkcaldy, the birthplace in 1723 of Adam Smith and, by extension, of modern economics, is also of course, where your chancellor was reared. \"I am led to ponder to what extent the chancellor\\'s renowned economic and financial skills are the result of exposure to the subliminal intellect-enhancing emanation in this area.\" He continued: \"Smith reached far beyond the insights of his predecessors to frame a global view of how market economics, just then emerging, worked. \"In so doing he supported changes in societal organisation that were to measurably enhance standards of living.\"\\n \\n Dr Greenspan said Smith\\'s revolutionary philosophy on human self-interest, laissez-faire economics and competition had been a force for good in the world. \"The incredible insights of a handful of intellectuals of the Enlightenment - especially with Smith toiling in the environs of Kirkcaldy - created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual self-interest,\" he said. Following his lecture, Dr Greenspan - who received an honorary knighthood from the Queen at Balmoral in 2002 - was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He later opened an exhibition dedicated to Smith in the atrium of Fife College of Further and Higher Education. Joyce Johnston, principal of the college, said: \"It is very fitting that the world\\'s premier economist delivered this lecture in tribute to the world\\'s first economist.\" Dr Greenspan - who became chairman of the Federal Reserve for an unprecedented fifth term in June 2004 - will step down in January next year. He has served under Presidents George W Bush, Bill Clinton, George Bush, and Ronald Reagan. He was also chairman of the council of economic advisors to Gerald Ford.\\n',\n",
       " 'Economy \\'strong\\' in election year\\n \\n UK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report.\\n \\n Optimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at BDO Stoy Hayward. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May. The BDO optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.\\n \\n The only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said. Its BDO\\'s output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. However, the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterling\\'s strength against the dollar and high oil prices, the group noted. Its inflation index, which has risen continuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in January from 108.0 in October last year. \"The UK is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,\" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. \"Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'SEC to rethink post-Enron rules\\n \\n The US stock market watchdog\\'s chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.\\n \\n In a speech at the London School of Economics, William Donaldson promised \"several initiatives\". European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly. The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\\n \\n The Act comes into force in mid-2005. It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.\\n \\n Firms that break the new law could face huge fines, while senior executives risk jail terms of up to 20 years. Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would \"continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements\". There are few, if any, who disagree with the intentions of the Act, which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts. But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.\\n \\n The 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy, a delisting. Mr Donaldson said the SEC would \"consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process\" for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements.\\n \\n \"We should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections\" without turning the US market into \"one with no exit\", he said. He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act\\'s least popular measure - Section 404 - for foreign firms. Seen as particularly costly to implement, Section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm\\'s internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (Â£374m).\\n \\n A delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change, the Financial Times reported.\\n \\n It was led by Digby Jones, director general of the UK\\'s Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and included representatives of BASF, Siemens and Cadbury Schweppes. Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings. Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (Â£558m) stock market debut last month. There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year. Instead, the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in Hong Kong, according to press reports in China.\\n',\n",

Mr Ghosn is to become chairman and chief executive of Renault, which owns 44% of the Japanese carmaker, in April. Mr Ghosn transformed Nissan into a fast-growing and profitable business.\\n \\n Mr Shiga will nominally serve as Mr Ghosn\\'s deputy.

Ukraine recently ousted long-serving leader Leonid Kuchma and has said it wants closer European Union links. In a separate statement, the EU said that the US should back Ukraine\\'s entry into the World Trade Organisation. The comments came as Viktor Yushchenko prepared to head to Brussels to meet with US President George W Bush and other North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) leaders. He is the only non-Nato member leader invited to attend the summit.\\n \\n Mr Yushchenko recently defeated Moscow-backed presidential candidate and Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych at the polls, and has made no secret of his wish to fight corruption and make Ukraine more transparent.\\n \\n Earlier this month, new Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms may have their privatisations put under the spotlight. Her comments raised concerns among a number of investors and Mr Yushchenko was seen on Monday as trying to soothe their frayed nerves. \"We acknowledge that business in Ukraine is now shaped and 98% of privatisations were carried out according to the law,\" Mr Yushchenko said on Monday. \"We have trust in this business and want to defend it by law,\" he continued, adding that any review would focus on \"dozens of companies, not hundreds or thousands\". He cited last year\\'s sale of Ukrainian steel producer Krivorizhstal as one that had raised concerns.

He said that while he understood that Ukraine was not ready for EU membership, the country needed to see progress on topics such as trade and visa requirements. \"We deserve an honest response,\" Mr Rybachuk told the Associated Press in an interview. \"We understand the difficulties. We refuse to understand double standards.\" Ukraine may find it has a sympathetic ear in Brussels \"The EU has reiterated that we support (Ukraine\\'s) fast accession to the WTO and if possible we would like that to happen some time during the year,\" said Claude Veron-Reville, a spokesman for EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson. \"We have said as much to the Americans. We feel that it is important for us all to pull together for Ukraine to be allowed into the WTO.

Creditors agreed on Friday to suspend interest payments until 2007. News of the deal had boosted shares in the club on Friday, but the stock slipped back 7% during Monday morning.\\n \\n In addition to the interest-payment freeze, Borussia Dortmund also will get short-term loans to help pay salaries.

On 14 March, one of these creditors - property investment fund Molsiris which owns the club\\'s stadium - holds its AGM at which it will discuss the rescue plan. Chief executive Gerd Niebaum stepped down last week and creditors have been pushing for a greater say in how the club is run.

       " 'Standard Life concern at LSE bid\\n \\n Standard Life is the latest shareholder in Deutsche Boerse to express concern at the German stock market operator\\'s plans to buy the London Stock Exchange.\\n \\n It said Deutsche Boerse had to show why its planned Â£1.35bn ($2.5bn) offer for the LSE was good for shareholder value. Reports say Standard Life, which owns a 1% stake in Deutsche Boerse, may seek a shareholder vote on the issue. Fellow shareholders US-based hedge fund Atticus Capital and UK-based TCI Fund Management have also expressed doubts.\\n \\n Deutsche Boerse\\'s supervisory board has approved the possible takeover of the LSE despite the signs of opposition from investors. \"The onus is on Deutsche Boerse\\'s management to demonstrate why the purchase of the LSE creates more value for shareholders than other strategies, such as a buyback,\" said Richard Moffat, investment director of UK Equities at Standard Life Investments. Atticus Capital, holding 2% of Deutsche Boerse, wants it to buy back its own shares rather than buy the LSE. And TCI which holds about 5%, has made a request for an extraordinary shareholders meeting to be held to vote on replacing the company\\'s entire supervisory board. It has also demanded that shareholders be consulted about the proposed acquisition, and whether the operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange should return $500m (Â£266m) to shareholders instead.\\n \\n In December, Deutsche Boerse, which also owns the derivatives market Eurex and the clearing firm Clearstream, put an informal offer of 530 pence per LSE share on the table. However, the LSE said the cash offer \"undervalued\" both its own business and the benefits of such a tie-up. Since then an improved offer from Deutsche Boerse has been anticipated as its management has continued talks with LSE chief executive Clara Furse. But the London exchange is also holding talks with Deutsche Boerse\\'s rival Euronext, which operates the Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris exchanges, as well as London-based international derivatives market Liffe.\\n',\n",

BP added that it was increasing its fourth-quarter dividend by 26% to 8.5 cents, and that it would continue with share buybacks. BP chief executive Lord Browne said the results were strong \"both operationally and financially.\"\\n \\n The company is earning about $1.8m an hour.\\n \\n Despite the record annual profits figure, BP\\'s performance was below the expectations of some City analysts. However, BP\\'s share price rose 4p or nearly 1% in morning trading to 548p. Its profit rise for the year included profits of $3.65bn (Â£1.97bn) for the final three months of 2004 - up from $2.89bn a year ago but below its third quarter.\\n \\n Speaking on the BBC\\'s Today programme on Tuesday, Lord Browne said the profits were not solely down to the high oil price alone.\\n \\n \"The profits are up more than the price of oil is up,\" he said. Lord Browne pointed out that BP was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration. \"We have spent many years buying (assets) when the price is low,\" he said. The company has made new discoveries in Egypt, the Gulf of Mexico and Angola.\\n \\n However, Lord Browne rejected calls for a windfall tax on his company\\'s huge profits, saying that in the North Sea it paid progressively more tax, the more profits it made. Lord Browne believes oil prices will remain quite high. Currently above $40 a barrel, he said: \"The price of oil will be well supported above $30 a barrel for the medium term.\" BP put production for the year at 3.997 billion barrels of oil, up 10% on 2003, but slightly lower than the four billion barrels it had initially aimed for.\\n',\n",

Miner Highland Gold said it regretted any limit on privatisation while BP, a big investor, declined to comment. Only firms at least 51% Russian-owned will be permitted to bid.\\n \\n The Federal Natural Resources Agency said \"the government is interested in letting Russian companies develop strategic resources\". The foreign ownership issue will be dealt with according to Russia\\'s competition law, natural resources minister Yuri Trutnev was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. No further details were given, with Mr Trutnev suggesting that Russia may decide on a case-by-case basis. Observers said that the move may represent a shift in policy, as the administration of Vladimir Putin puts the protection of national interests above free market dynamics. Russia recently wrested back control of a large chunk of its oil industry from stock-market listed company Yukos, a move that prompted calls of outrage from many investors.\\n \\n Analysts warned that it was still too early to draw too many conclusions from this new set of proposals.\\n \\n Companies echoed this sentiment, saying that they would require more information before ringing the alarm bells. \"It\\'s not good. But it is very understandable,\" said Al Breach, an economist at UBS Brunswick. \"But if the investment climate is stable - that\\'s much more important. \"Foreigners of course would like to have free entry but... this is not the end of the world.\" A number of other nations, including Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, protect their national resources from foreign firms. What has surprised observers is that since the collapse of communism Russia has been courting foreign investment.\\n \\n BP spent $7.5bn to create Russian-registered oil company TNK-BP, and has a partnership to develop the Sakhalin 5 petroleum field with state-owned Rosneft. Exxon, the world\\'s largest oil company, has signed preliminary agreements to develop the Sakhalin 3 field. Company spokesman Glenn Waller said Exxon still considered the deal valid, despite Russia inviting new offers for the land block. According to Mr Waller, Exxon \"were not planning to bid at a new tender anyway\". \"We regret the ministry has taken such a decision,\" said Ivan Kulakov, deputy chairman of Highland Gold - a mining firm that has the motto \"Bringing Russia\\'s Gold to Market\". \"It would be a shame if that has a negative impact on the investment climate.\" Other firms that have been linked with investment in Russia include France\\'s Total, the US-based ChevronTexaco, and miner Barrick Gold.\\n',\n",

US gaming consortium BLB will pay $339m (Â£182.5m) for the US unit, although the deal is subject to certain conditions. BLB holds a 22% stake in Wembley and last year came close to buying the whole firm in a Â£308m takeover deal. Shares in Wembley were up 56 pence, or 7.6%, at 797p by mid-morning.\\n \\n The sale of the US gaming unit will leave Wembley with its UK business. This includes greyhound tracks at Wimbledon in London, Belle Vue in Manchester, Perry Barr and Hall Green in Birmingham, Oxford and Portsmouth. Analysts have valued the six tracks at between Â£40m-Â£50m. The US business accounts for about 90% of Wembley\\'s operating profit and consists of operations in Rhode Island and Colorado. BLB\\'s purchase of the US unit is subject to the agreement of a revenue-sharing deal being struck with Rhode Island authorities. Wembley said that, once the deal was completed, it anticipated returning surplus cash to shareholders. \"Whilst the completion of the sale of the US Gaming Division remains subject to a number of conditions, we believe this development is a positive step towards the maximisation of value for shareholders,\" said Wembley chairman Claes Hultman. Wembley sold the English national football stadium in 1999 to concentrate on its gaming operations.\\n',\n",

In a statement, the club said it would allow Mr Glazer \"limited due diligence\" to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid. But it said it continued to oppose Mr Glazer\\'s plans, calling his assumptions \"aggressive\" and his plan \"damaging\". Many of Manchester United\\'s supporters own shares in the club, and the fan-based group Shareholders United is strongly opposed to any takeover by Mr Glazer. About 300 fans protested outside the Old Trafford ground two days ago.\\n \\n Rival local club Manchester City has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play a televised match on Sunday.\\n \\n Manchester United\\'s response comes as little surprise, as the board made clear. \"Any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal,\" the club said in its statement. Should it become a firm offer, it should be at a price that \"the board is likely to regard as fair\" and on terms which \"may be deliverable\". But it also stressed that it stayed opposed to Mr Glazer\\'s proposal. \"The board continues to believe that Mr Glazer\\'s business plan assumptions are aggressive,\" the statement said, \"and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging.\" Whether or not the bid is attractive in monetary terms, in the case of Manchester United many investors hold the stock for sentimental rather than financial reasons. At present, Mr Glazer and his family hold a 28.1% stake, making them Manchester United\\'s second biggest shareholders. They own the successful Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team based in Florida. If the family makes a formal offer, they will need the support of the club\\'s biggest shareholders.\\n \\n Irish horse racing millionaires JP McManus and John Magnier own 29% of United through their investment vehicle Cubic Expression, and have yet to express a view on the bid approach.\\n \\n A group of five MPs are calling on the Department of Trade and Industry to block any takeover of the club by the US football magnate on public interest grounds. They have signed a House of Commons motion, and Tony Lloyd, the Manchester Central MP, whose constituency includes the club\\'s Old Trafford ground, has pledged to take the matter \"to Tony Blair if necessary\". The Commons motion says \"any takeover designed to transform the club into a private company would be against the interests of those supporters and football\". However, the DTI has dismissed the proposal. A spokesman said the department did not believe there was a case for changing the Enterprise Act so that takeovers of football clubs could be looked at on non-competition grounds. Mr Glazer\\'s offer values the club at Â£800m ($1.5bn). Pitched at 300p per share, it also relies less on debt to finance it than an earlier approach from the US tycoon, which was rejected out of hand. Manchester United shares closed at 270.25p on Friday, down 3.75p on the day.\\n',\n",

Sales in what is traditionally a strong month rose by 0.5% on a like-for-like basis, compared with a year earlier. Consumers remain cautious over buying big-ticket items like furniture, said BRC director general Kevin Hawkins. Higher interest rates and uncertainty over the housing market continue to take their toll on the retail sector, the BRC said. But clothing and footwear sales were said to be generally better than December, while department stores also had a good month.\\n \\n In the three-months to January, like-for-like sales showed a growth rate of -0.1%, the same as in the three months to December, the BRC said. \"Following a relatively strong New Year\\'s bank holiday, trading then took a downward turn,\" said Mr Hawkins. \"Even extending some promotions and discounts and the pay-day boost later in the month could not tempt customers.\" The previous BRC survey found Christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years for retailers. And according to Office for National Statistics data, sales in December failed to meet expectations and by some counts were the worst since 1981.\\n',\n",

McDonald\\'s golden arches, name and \"I\\'m loving it\" catchphrase will be used throughout the half-hour programme. The move comes amid growing concerns about obesity in Europe and the US.\\n \\n The European Union has called on the food industry to reduce the number of adverts aimed at young children, warning that legislation would be introduced. unless voluntary steps were taken. In the US, food group Kraft is among firms that already have cut back on promoting sugar and fattening products to the young. McDonalds has also been taking steps to improve its junk food reputation, revamping its menu and providing clients with health-related products such as pedometers. As well as burgers like the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder with Cheese, the company now sells healthier options such as salads and fresh fruit. Chief executive Jim Skinner attributed an 8.3% increase in January worldwide sales to the \"vitality of our menu\", among other things.\\n \\n Hooking up with MTV is expected to add extra momentum to McDonald\\'s recent revival. MTV, which played a key role in the emergence of the music video, is to show Advance Warning on all 25 of its channels across the world. The programme can at present only been seen in the US, where it has featured artists like British stars Joss Stone and Franz Ferdinand.

According to its estimate, as much as 13.6% of the loans made by private banks to clients in the disaster zone has been written off or damaged. State-owned lenders may be even worse hit, it said.\\n \\n The association estimates that the private banking sector has 25bn rupees ($250m; Â£135m) of loans outstanding in the disaster zone. On one hand, banks are dealing with the death of their customers, along with damaged or destroyed collateral. On the other, most are extending cheap loans for rebuilding and recovery, as well as giving their clients more time to repay existing borrowing. The combination means a revenue shortfall during 2005, SLBA chairman - and Commercial Bank managing director - AL Gooneratne told a news conference. \"Most banks have given moratoriums and will not be collecting interest, at least in this quarter,\" he said. In the public sector, more than one in ten of the state-owned People\\'s Bank\\'s customers in the south of Sri Lanka were affected, a bank spokesman told Reuters.

Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer, which looks set to receive more serious scrutiny. The club has previously rejected Mr Glazer\\'s approaches out of hand. But a senior source at the club told the BBC: \"This time it\\'s different.\" Supporters\\' group Shareholders United, however, urged the club to reject the new deal.\\n \\n A spokesman for the Shareholders United said: \"I can\\'t see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer\\'s previous proposals) other than Â£200m less debt. \"He isn\\'t bringing any money into the club; he\\'ll use our money to buy it.\"\\n \\n Mr Glazer\\'s latest move is being led by Mr Glazer\\'s two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times. A proposal was received by David Gill, United\\'s chief executive, at the end of last week, pitched at about 300p a share. David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a \"well funded\" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club.\\n \\n \"I do not think there is anything that Manchester United fans can do about it,\" he told the BBC. \"They can complain about it but it is curtains for them. They may not want him but they are going to get him.\" The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with \"detailed proposals\", it has confirmed.\\n \\n Mr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. He is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal, though it is not clear by how much. For his proposal to succeed, he needs the support of United\\'s largest shareholders, the Irish horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier. They own 29% of United through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle. Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid. NM Rothschild, the investment bank, is advising Mr Glazer, according to the Financial Times. His previous adviser, JPMorgan, quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board, against its advice.

Yukos says the sale was illegal and is pursuing damages in a US court. Its lawyers now accept ABN Amro, BNP Paribas, Calyon, JP Morgan Chase Bank, and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein were not involved in the sale financing. However, Yukos still has an outstanding complaint against Deutsche Bank, which it alleges to be the leader of a consortium that was behind a bid for Yugansk by state gas monopoly Gazprom. The company has also accused Gazprom, the Russian Federation and two other Russian firms.\\n \\n Gazprom had been expected to win the December auction, but ended up not bidding. Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The firm, whose finance chief is now based in the US, filed for bankruptcy in Houston, Texas, and sought a court injunction against the sale. But Deutsche Bank has suggested Yukos artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset.

The review will cover production of gold, aluminium and iron ore although it excludes the country\\'s oil sector. Chavez has sought to extend the state\\'s role in all sectors of the economy.\\n \\n The left-wing president is conducting a controversial review of land ownership in the country while also seeking to create a state-run telecoms firm to compete with foreign-owned businesses.\\n \\n He has argued that major economic reforms are vital to improve the lives of Venezuela\\'s poorest citizens. Announcing the review of raw material production, minister Victor Alvarez said the government would seek to transfer technology, training capability and content from projects with foreign partners. \"We are defending our national sovereignty over the use of our national resources which must serve the endogenous development of the nation,\" Mr Alvarez said. \"For this reason we are reviewing all memorandums of understanding, all letters of intent, all agreements that have been signed, all contracts, to check which of these comply with these directives. \"Everything, absolutely everything, has to be reviewed.\"\\n \\n Venezuela has previously assured foreign companies with operations in the mineral rich country that it respects existing contracts. However, the government insisted that it needed to develop its own industrial infrastructure in order to create new jobs and lessen its reliance on foreign partners. \"If we don\\'t do this, we are just going to carry on being slaves, suppliers of raw materials, all our lives and we will never develop our own productive capacity,\" Mr Alvarez added.

The call came in a speech on improving the London insurance market.\\n \\n \"The FSA should not bide their time and \\'wait and see\\'. They should seize the moment,\" Mr Prettejohn, Lloyd\\'s chief executive said. The FSA took over regulation of the general insurance sector in January, but it sidestepped calls to require brokers to disclose the commissions they earn from insurers to their clients. Last week, the City watchdog gave brokers and insurers guidance on managing conflicts of interest. Brokers must give information on their commissions if, and only if, their customers request it, the FSA said.\\n \\n In the US, lack of transparency about brokers\\' commissions has led to problems. The world\\'s biggest insurance broker Marsh & McLennan said last week it would pay $850m to settle charges, raised by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in October, that it sought to rig bids in conjunction with insurers. The probe centred around so-called contingent commissions, whereby brokers were rewarded according to how much business they brought to an insurer, an arrangement that did not always benefit brokers\\' customers.

Life expectancy at birth is 71 years for a manual worker and 79 years for a professional - a gap of eight years. But if measured at age 65 instead, the PPI said, a manual worker will live to 81 years and a professional worker to 86 years - a gap of just five years. The PPI\\'s estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach 65 years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy.\\n \\n The government has ruled out raising the state pension age, because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies. Chris Curry, PPI research director, said its calculations suggested there could be more pressure on state pension spending than originally envisaged. \"Even people in social class V [unskilled manual workers] who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live 16 years after state pension age,\" he said.

The introduction of \\'chip and pin\\' cards has tightened security for transactions on the High Street. But the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack, Retail Decisions said.\\n \\n The introduction of chip and pin cards aimed to cut down on credit card fraud in stores by asking shoppers to verify their identity with a confidential personal pin number, instead of a signature. Retail Decisions chief executive Carl Clump told the BBC that there was \"no doubt\" that chip and pin would \"reduce card fraud in the card-present environment\". \"However, it is important to monitor what happens in the card-not-present environment as fraudsters will turn their attention to the internet, mail order, telephone order and interactive TV,\" he said. \"We have seen a 22% uplift in card-not-present fraud here in the UK... since the start of the year. \"Fraud doesn\\'t just disappear, it mutates to the next weakest link in the chain,\" he said.\\n \\n Retail Decisions\\' survey on the implementation of chip and pin found that shoppers had adapted easily to the new system, but that banks\\' performance in distributing the new cards had been patchy, at best. \"The main issue is that not everyone has the pins they need,\" said Mr Clump. Nearly two thirds - 65% - of the 1,000 people interviewed said they had used chip and pin to make payments. Of these, 83% were happy with the experience, though nearly a quarter said they struggled to remember their pin number. However, only 34% said they had received replacement cards with the necessary \\'chip\\' technology from all their card providers. Furthermore, 16% said that none of their cards had been replaced, while 30% said only some had. UK shoppers spent Â£5.3bn on plastic cards in 2003, the last full year for which figures are available from the Association of Payment Clearing Services (Apacs). Altogether, card scams on UK-issued cards totalled Â£402.4m in 2003. Card-not-present fraud rose an annual 6% to Â£116.4m, making it the biggest category even then.

       " 'Firms pump billions into pensions\\n \\n Employers have spent billions of pounds propping up their final salary pensions over the past year, research suggests.\\n \\n A survey of 280 schemes by Incomes Data Services\\' (IDS) said employer contributions had increased from Â£5.5bn to Â£8.2bn a year, a rise of 49.7%. Companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by 100% or more, IDS said. Many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open, because of rising costs and increased liabilities. A final salary scheme, also known as a defined benefit scheme, promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire.\\n \\n The rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase, or defined contribution, schemes. These are less risky for employers. Under money purchase schemes, employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity - a policy which pays out an income until death - on retirement.\\n \\n IDS said there were some schemes in good health.\\n \\n But, in many cases, firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle \"yawning deficits\". The level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late 1990s. In 1998/99, for example, contributions rose by 4.7% and in 2002/03 by 8.6%. In contrast, between 1996 and 1998, some employers cut their contribution levels. Helen Sudell, editor of the IDS Pensions Service, said the rise in contributions was \"staggering\" and the highest ever recorded by IDS. \"We have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision,\" said Ms Sudell. \"With figures like this there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'UK homes hit Â£3.3 trillion total\\n \\n The value of the UK\\'s housing stock reached the Â£3.3 trillion mark in 2004 - triple the value 10 years earlier, a report indicates.\\n \\n Research from Halifax, the country\\'s biggest mortgage lender, suggests the value of private housing stock is continuing to rise steadily. All regions saw at least a doubling in their assets during the past decade. But Northern Ireland led the way with a 262% rise, while Scotland saw the smallest increase of just 112%.\\n \\n The core retail price index rose by just 28% in the same period, underlining how effective an investment in housing has been for most people during the past decade. More than a third of the UK\\'s private housing assets - representing more than a trillion pounds in value - are concentrated in London and the South East, the Halifax\\'s figures indicate. Tim Crawford, Group Economist at Halifax, said: \"The value of the private housing stock continues to grow and the family home remains, by a large margin, the most valuable asset of the majority of households in the UK.\" Halifax\\'s own monthly figures on house sales - issued on Thursday - suggest the average price of a British property now stands at Â£163,748 after a 0.8% rise in January. Housing experts are split on prospects for the market, with some saying price growth will slow but not fall, while others predict a sharp drop in values.\\n',\n",
       " 'Economy \\'strong\\' in election year\\n \\n UK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report.\\n \\n Optimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at BDO Stoy Hayward. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May. The BDO optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.\\n \\n The only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said. Its BDO\\'s output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. However, the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterling\\'s strength against the dollar and high oil prices, the group noted. Its inflation index, which has risen continuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in January from 108.0 in October last year. \"The UK is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,\" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. \"Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'G7 backs Africa debt relief plan\\n \\n G7 finance ministers have backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world\\'s poorest countries.\\n \\n UK chancellor Gordon Brown said the London meeting of the world\\'s seven richest nations would be remembered as \"the 100% debt relief summit\". Some 37 countries could benefit after a case-by-case review by bodies including the World Bank and the IMF, he said. But the US says it cannot support Mr Brown\\'s International Finance Facility to boost aid to developing countries. BBC correspondents said the meeting had produced some movement towards the UK\\'s ambitions, but much work was needed. Mr Brown said it was a major breakthrough for the international organisations to offer up to 100% multilateral debt relief - \"the vast bulk\" of money owed by the poorest countries.\\n \\n \"We could be at the beginning of the final stage of the process where the debts that were owed by the poorest countries, built up over 20 or 30 years, debts that are simply unpayable in the real world, are finally taken care of,\" he said. He added: \"It is the richest countries hearing the voices of the poor.\" But he said they would insist on government reforms and the need for transparency, tackling corruption and openness from both the poorest and richest nations. BBC correspondent Patrick Bartlett said while it was an agreement in principle, the organisations involved now have to look at how it would work in practice. Oxfam senior policy adviser Max Lawson welcomed the statement and said G7 ministers had \"passed the first hurdle of 2005\".\\n \\n But he added: \"They need to move quickly to turn their proposals into real change for the world\\'s poorest. \"Two million children will die needlessly between now and the next meeting in April. If rich countries are going to keep their promises to tackle obscene poverty they need deliver - and deliver quickly.\" Talks are continuing on how to finance increased overseas development assistance. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is to look at a proposal to use its gold supplies to help the debt relief effort when it meets in April. Mr Brown said G7 ministers had agreed to defer debt interest payments and repayments for some countries affected by the tsunami until the end of 2005. But UK plans for an International Finance Facility (IFF) to help deal with debt in the developing world have not been agreed. Mr Brown wanted to provide $10bn (Â£5.38bn) a year over a decade, using G7 backing so the money could be borrowed up front on financial markets.\\n \\n It is a key element of his proposals for a modern version of the Marshall Plan, which brought US aid to rebuild Europe after World War II, for the developing world. Mr Brown said it was \"winning support every day\" and said a programme had been agreed to draw up more details in time for the G8 summit in July. But US Treasury Under-Secretary John Taylor said the US could not support the IFF because of its \"legislative process\". \"The US is completely committed to poverty reduction and providing financing to do that,\" he said. \"But this particular mechanism does not work for the United States. It works for other countries, and that is fine.\" Earlier, he told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme the US had increased support for Africa in the past four years from $1.1bn per year to $4.6bn per year. But South Africa Finance Minister Trevor Manuel told the BBC\\'s Talking Point programme what was needed was one approach, with all wealthy nations on board. He said much of the money pledged by the US had not yet been dispensed.\\n \\n The UK has made poverty in the poorest nations a key theme for its 2005 presidency of the Group of Eight (G8), which comprises the G7 and Russia. The G8 countries will meet at Gleneagles in Scotland. At a dinner on Friday night, former South African president Nelson Mandela backed Mr Brown\\'s plan when he urged the finance chiefs to write-off African debt and provide an extra $50bn (Â£26.69bn) a year in aid for the next decade. Talks also centred on the impact of the rising economies of China and India, the US budget and trade deficits, how the US, Europe and Japan can act to boost global economic growth, and HIV/Aids. G7 ministers called for more flexibility in international exchange rates and said \"excess volatility\" would impede economic growth. Representatives from China, India, Russia, South Africa and Brazil were invited to attend some of the sessions. A G8 summit is set to take place in July.\\n',\n",
       " 'Q&A: Malcolm Glazer and Man Utd\\n \\n The battle for control of Manchester United has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from US business tycoon Malcolm Glazer.\\n \\n No formal offer has been made yet, but Manchester United have confirmed they have received a \"detailed proposal\" from the US entrepreneur which could lead to a bid. Reports have put the offer at 300p per share, which would value Manchester United at about Â£800m ($1.5bn). The approach by the 76-year-old owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team is reportedly being led by his two sons, Avi and Joel. A previous approach to the United board by Mr Glazer in October last year was turned down. However, the BBC has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand.\\n \\n Mr Glazer\\'s previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover. That would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed \"not... in the best interests of the company\" by Manchester United\\'s board when they rejected his approach last year. However, Mr Glazer\\'s latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by Â£200m.\\n \\n While United\\'s board may be casting a serious eye over Mr Glazer\\'s latest proposals, supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal.\\n \\n Supporters\\' group Shareholders United - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to Mr Glazer\\'s campaign - said it would fight any move. \"Manchester United are a debt-free company. We don\\'t want to fall into debt and we don\\'t need to fall into debt,\" Shareholders United\\'s Sean Bones told the BBC. United\\'s players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover. \"A lot of people want the club\\'s interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart,\" Rio Ferdinand told BBC Radio Five Live. \"No-one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table.\"\\n \\n The key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of United\\'s largest shareholders, the Irish horse racing tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus. Through their Cubic Expression vehicle they own 28.9% of the club. Mr Glazer owns 28.1%. Joe McLean, a football specialist at accountancy firm Grant Thornton, said the support of Mr Magnier and Mr McManus was \"utterly crucial\". \"Mr Glazer\\'s bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment. \"If that\\'s the case, the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about 300 pence, maybe 305. \"If that\\'s the case then Mr Glazer might well secure their support - if he does, this bid could well go ahead.\"\\n \\n Indeed it is. Malcolm Glazer was little-known in the UK until he started to build up his stake in Manchester United in late 2003. In February 2004 he said he was \"considering\" whether to bid for the club. No bid emerged, but Mr Glazer continued to increase his holding in the club. In October 2004, Manchester United said they had received a \"preliminary approach\", which turned out to have come from Mr Glazer. However, the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve. At the club\\'s annual general meeting in November, Mr Glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board. Legal adviser Maurice Watkins, commercial director Andy Anson and non-executive director Philip Yea were voted out, against the wishes of chief executive David Gill. But the move led to bankers JP Morgan and public relations firm Brunswick withdrawing from the Glazer bid team.\\n',\n",
       " \"Making your office work for you\\n \\n Our mission to brighten up your working lives continues - and this time, we're taking a long hard look at your offices.\\n \\n Over the next few months, our panel of experts will be listening to your gripes about where you work, and suggesting ways to make your workspace more efficient, more congenial or simply prettier. This week, we're hearing from Marianne Petersen, who is planning to convert a barn in Sweden into a base for her freelance writing work. Click on the link under her photograph to read her story, and then scroll down to see what the panel have to say. And if you want to take part in the series, go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch.\\n \\n Working from home presents a multitude of challenges. Understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style. Do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others? Are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done? Do you build on the ideas of others - or are you a more introspective problem solver?. In order for a virtual office to succeed, keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential. It may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit, and to keep strict office hours. Referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space. It is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours, keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network. Isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out, and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry. Joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like-minded people may assist. It is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy - with the danger that when the workload eases, they have to be resurrected.\\n \\n \\n \\n Prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight, and the structure is checked for stability. It appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing.\\n \\n Ideally, the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn. This would also allow for a well-insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured. It is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity. In order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating, power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate. Ideally, it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities. The walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed, and the walls should be painted in a light colour. The owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks; this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface. I would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn. As for lighting, consider a combination of floor mounted uplights, wall lights (wall washers) and selected downlights. Use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior.\\n \\n \\n \\n Please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for Marianne's barn.\\n \\n The layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space. Large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available. The finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting, while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace.\\n \\n \\n \\n Regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house, your plan of going wireless is sensible. A wireless router/access point in the house with a wireless LAN card in the PC in the renovated area may be sufficient. However, important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass, which could result in a weak signal strength. You may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area. Your local IT supplier will be able to advise on this. If you haven't already invested in robust firewall and anti-virus software, it is essential to do so, to protect your investment. To really take advantage of wireless technology, you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor. Or you could use one of the new Tablet computers, which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built-in hand recognition software. And finally, you will save money and space by considering a multi-function product for print, scan, copy and fax.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Market unfazed by Aurora setback\\n \\n As the Aurora limped back to its dock on 20 January, a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe.\\n \\n The ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble. And its owner, P&O Cruises - now part of the huge US Carnival Corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year\\'s profits and a potential PR fiasco. No-one, however, seems to have told the stock markets. The warning of a five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world\\'s biggest investment banks had upped its target for Carnival\\'s share price, from Â£35 to Â£36.20. Other investors barely blinked, and by 1300 GMT Carnival\\'s shares in London were down a single penny, or 0.03%, at Â£32.26.\\n \\n Why the mismatch between the public perception and the market\\'s response? \"The Aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,\" says Deutsche Bank\\'s Simon Champion. \"It was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company - it was a long cruise, after all. But the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events.\"\\n \\n Despite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, Aurora is just one vessel in a large Carnival fleet, the UK\\'s P&O Princess group having been merged into the much larger US firm in 2003. And generally speaking, Carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule. \"Carnival has an incredibly strong track record,\" Mr Champion.\\n \\n Similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. The hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the Aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. That should mitigate some of the PR risk, both for Carnival and its main competitor, Royal Caribbean. \"While not common, cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry,\" wrote analysts from Citigroup Smith Barney in a note to clients on Friday. \"Moreover, such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises.\" After all, the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK - but for Carnival customers elsewhere it\\'s unlikely to make too much of a splash.\\n \\n Assuming that Citigroup is right, and demand stays solid, the structure of the industry also works in Carnival\\'s favour. In the wake of P&O Princess\\'s takeover by Carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly. Given the expense of building, outfitting and running a cruise ship, \"slowing supply growth\" is a certainty, said David Anders at Merrill Lynch on Thursday. In other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited. And with Carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated Aurora in the future.\\n',\n",
       " 'The \\'ticking budget\\' facing the US\\n \\n The budget proposals laid out by the administration of US President George W Bush are highly controversial. The Washington-based Economic Policy Institute, which tends to be critical of the President, looks at possible fault lines. US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy. Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together. News coverage of the Bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts, but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs. From the standpoint of the big fiscal trends, the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come. Under direct threat will be the federal government\\'s ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund. As soon as 2018, the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits.\\n \\n The trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates, to more than half the nation\\'s total annual output.\\n \\n This upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business. Even now, a growing share of US borrowing is from abroad. The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China, among other nations. This does not bode well for US influence in the world. The decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue. The dollar is already sinking. Before too long, credit markets are likely to react, and interest rates will creep upwards. That will be the shock.\\n \\n Interest-sensitive industries will feel pain immediately - sectors such as housing, automobiles, other consumer durables, agriculture, and small business. Some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the US Capitol in the late 1970s. There will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget. The public outcry will force Congress to act. Whether it will act wisely is another matter. How did this happen?\\n \\n By definition, the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn\\'t adequately capture the current situation. Federal revenues are at 1950s levels, while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher. In addition, the United States has two significant military missions. The Bush administration\\'s chosen remedy is the least feasible one. Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating \"waste, fraud and abuse\" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem. Indeed, if Congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way, there would hardly be any such spending left. Law enforcement, space exploration, environmental clean-up, economic development, the Small Business Administration, housing, veterans\\' benefits, aid to state and local governments would all but disappear. It\\'s fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed. The biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor. To some extent, increases in these areas are inevitable. The US population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats in the world. But serious savings can only be found where the big money is. Savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system, public and private. Brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation\\'s elderly and indigent.\\n \\n On the revenue side, the lion\\'s share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since 2000 will have to be replaced.\\n \\n Some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes. Finally, blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned. There is no good reason to fixate on it, anyway. Moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely. Borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense. The sooner we face that reality, the sooner workable reforms can be pursued. First on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue, simplify the tax code, and restore some fairness eroded by the Bush tax cuts. Second should be a dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years, much of it unrelated to Afghanistan, Iraq, or terrorism. Third must be the start of a serious debate on large-scale health care reform. One thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the US economy and government for the challenges of this new century.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ebbers \\'aware\\' of WorldCom fraud\\n \\n Former WorldCom boss Bernie Ebbers was directly involved in the $11bn financial fraud at the firm, his closest associate has told a US court.\\n \\n Giving evidence in the criminal trial of Mr Ebbers, ex-finance chief Scott Sullivan implicated his colleague in the accounting scandal at the firm. Mr Sullivan, WorldCom\\'s former number two, is the government\\'s chief witness in its case against Mr Ebbers. Mr Ebbers has denied multiple charges of conspiracy and fraud.\\n \\n Senior WorldCom executives are accused of orchestrating a huge fraud at the former telecoms company in which they exaggerated revenues and hid the cost of expenses. The firm was forced into bankruptcy, the largest in US history. Mr Sullivan, 42, pleaded guilty to fraud last year and agreed to assist the government with its case against Mr Ebbers.\\n \\n Prosecutors have alleged that Mr Ebbers, 63, directed Mr Sullivan to hide the true state of the company\\'s finances by providing false information to the firm\\'s accountants. Mr Ebbers has denied all the charges, saying he was unaware of the fraud. His lawyers claim that their client was unfamiliar with detailed accounting practices and left that side of the business to Mr Sullivan.\\n \\n However, on Monday Mr Sullivan named Mr Ebbers as one of five executives who participated in the accounting fraud. \"He [Ebbers] has got a hands-on grasp of financial information,\" Mr Sullivan told a New York court. On his first day of questioning, Mr Sullivan admitted to falsifying the company\\'s financial statements.\\n \\n \"We did not disclose these adjustments,\" he said. \"We did not talk about these adjustments and the information was false.\" Mr Sullivan said his former boss knew more about accounting matters than many chief financial officers and described him as \"detail-oriented\".\\n \\n He portrayed Mr Ebbers, a charismatic businessman who built up WorldCom from a small regional operator into one of America\\'s largest telecoms firms, as obsessed with costs. \"He would talk about that there were more coffee filters than coffee bags and that means employees are taking coffee home,\" he said. \"We needed to cut expenses. We needed to cut a lot more than coffee expenses.\" Mr Sullivan is at the centre of the government\\'s case against Mr Ebbers. Mr Ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing.\\n',\n",
       " 'Renault boss hails \\'great year\\'\\n \\n Strong sales outside western Europe helped Renault boost its profits by more than 40% in 2004 although the firm warned of lower margins this year.\\n \\n France\\'s second largest carmaker enjoyed a healthy 43% rise in net profits to 2.4bn euros ($3.1bn; Â£2.9bn) as sales rose 8% to 40.7bn euros. The firm said strong demand outside western Europe and the good performance of its Megane range lifted its results. Chairman Louis Schweitzer said 2004 had been a \"great year\" for the firm.\\n \\n Renault sold more than 2.4 million vehicles in 2004, an increase of 4% on the previous year. Growth came mainly from outside western Europe, with particularly strong sales in Turkey, Russia and North Africa.\\n \\n In total, sales outside western Europe - Renault\\'s core market - rose 16.5%. Japanese carmaker Nissan - in which Renault owns a 44% stake - contributed 1.7bn euros in net income over the year. Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn is to succeed Mr Schweitzer at the head of Renault later this year.\\n \\n Renault said the outlook for the industry in Europe this year was \"stable\", with small growth forecast in other regions. The firm will benefit from the launch of a new Clio model in the coming year and the roll-out of the Logan in many markets. However, the firm said it expected operating margins to be lower in 2005, at 4% of sales as opposed to 5%. \"In a sluggish market and an environment impacted by the rise in raw material prices, Renault intends to continue to grow its global sales,\" the company said in a statement.\\n',\n",
       " \"Survey confirms property slowdown\\n \\n Government figures have confirmed a widely reported slowdown of the UK's housing market in late 2004.\\n \\n House prices were 11.8% higher on the year in the last quarter of 2004, down from 16.3% in the July-to-September quarter, the Land Registry said. The average house price in England and Wales was Â£182,920, down from Â£187,971 in July-September. The volume of sales between October and December dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in 2003. The government figures are the first official confirmation of falls in the market at the end of 2004. Land Registry figures are less up to date than those of banks and building societies, since they record completions not mortgage approvals. However, the figures are viewed as the most accurate measure of house prices as they include all property transactions, including cash sales.\\n \\n The cost of buying a home fell in seven out of 10 regions between the third and fourth quarters of 2004.\\n \\n The biggest annual gains were made in Wales, where house prices were up by 23% in the fourth quarter. House prices rose the slowest in Greater London, being up by 6%. In the capital, the volume of sales fell by 23% from 36,185 in 2003 to 28,041 for the same period in 2004. There was also a decline in the number of million-pound properties sold in the capital, with 436 properties over Â£1m sold compared to 469 for the same period in 2003. Although the figures point to a slowdown in the market, the most recent surveys from Nationwide and Halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival. After registering falls at the back end of 2004, Halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in January and Nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year. Members of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee will make their latest decision on interest rates on Thursday.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Bush budget seeks deep cutbacks\\n \\n President Bush has presented his 2006 budget, cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at $427bn (Â£230bn) this year.\\n \\n The $2.58 trillion (Â£1.38 trillion) budget submitted to Congress affects 150 domestic programmes from farming to the environment, education and health. But foreign aid is due to rise by 10%, with more money to treat HIV/Aids and reward economic and political reform. Military spending is also set to rise by 4.8%, to reach $419.3bn. The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.\\n \\n Congress will spend several months debating George W Bush\\'s proposal.\\n \\n The state department\\'s planned budget would rise to just under $23bn - a fraction of the defence department\\'s request - including almost $6bn to assist US allies in the \"war on terror\". However, the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle HIV/Aids, the BBC\\'s Jonathan Beale reports, and planned spending would almost double to $3bn, with much of that money going to African nations. Mr Bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his Millennium Challenge Corporation. The scheme has been set up to reward developing countries that embrace what the US considers to be good governance and sound policies. Yet Mr Bush\\'s proposed spending of $3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of $5bn.\\n \\n A key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration\\'s proposed radical overhaul of Social Security, the pensions programme on which many Americans rely for their retirement income.\\n \\n Some experts believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5 trillion over a 20-year period. Neither does the budget include any cash to purchase crude oil for the US emergency petroleum stockpile. Concern over the level of the reserve, created in 1970s, has led to rises in oil prices over the past year. The Bush administration will instead continue to fill the reserve by taking oil - rather than cash - from energy companies that drill under federal leases.\\n \\n The outline proposes reductions in budgets at 12 out of 23 government agencies including cuts of 9.6% at Agriculture and 5.6% at the Environmental Protection Agency. The spending plan for the year beginning 1 October is banking on a healthy US economy to boost government income by 6.1% to $2.18 trillion. Spending is forecast to grow by 3.5% to $2.57 trillion. But the budget is still the tightest yet under Mr Bush\\'s presidency. \"In order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government,\" Mr Bush said in his budget message to Congress. Mr Bush has promised to halve the US\\'s massive budget deficit within five years. The deficit, partly the result of massive tax cuts early in Mr Bush\\'s presidency, has been a key factor in pushing the US dollar lower. The independent Congressional Budget Office estimates that the shortfall could shrink to little more than $200bn by 2009, returning to the surpluses seen in the late 1990s by 2012. But its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent, in line with the promise when they were passed that they would \"sunset\", or disappear, in 2010. Most Republicans, however, want them to stay in place. And the figures also rely on the \"Social Security trust fund\" - the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions - being offset against the main budget deficit.\\n',\n",
       " \"Profits stall at China's Lenovo\\n \\n Profits at Chinese computer firm Lenovo have stood still amid slowing demand at home and stiffening competition.\\n \\n The firm is in the international spotlight after last year signing a deal to buy the PC division of personal computer pioneer IBM. Lenovo's profit for the three months to December was HK$327m (US$42m; Â£22m), less than 1% up on the year before. Chinese PC sales have risen by a fifth in each of the past two years, but are now growing more slowly. The company is still by far the biggest player in China, with more than a quarter of the market. But Western firms such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in China, and Lenovo's sales were down 3.7% by revenue to HK$6.31bn.\\n \\n If the $1.75bn agreement Lenovo signed with IBM on 8 December goes through, it will mark the end of an era. IBM pioneered the desktop PC market in the early 1980s, although strategic mis-steps helped lose it its early dominance. In any case, margins in PC market are now wafer thin, and profits have been hard to come by for most vendors except direct-sales giant Dell. But investors have been less than impressed with Lenovo's move, designed to take it out of China and further onto the world stage. Its shares are down 20% since the announcement two months ago, largely because of the unprofitability of the unit it is buying. There have been rumours that the deal could be in trouble because US government agencies fear it could offer China opportunities for industrial espionage. The reports of the possibility of an investigation into the risk sent Lenovo's shares up 6% in late January.\\n\",\n",
       " \"MCI shares climb on takeover bid\\n \\n Shares in US phone company MCI have risen on speculation that it is in takeover talks.\\n \\n The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Qwest has bid $6.3bn (Â£3.4bn) for MCI. Other firms have also expressed an interest in MCI, the second-largest US long-distance phone firm, and may now table rival bids, analysts said. Shares in MCI, which changed its name from Worldcom when it emerged from bankruptcy, were up 2.4% at $20.15. Press reports suggest that Qwest and MCI may reach an agreement as early as next week, although rival bids may muddy the waters. The largest US telephone company Verizon has previously held preliminary merger discussions with MCI, Reuters quoted sources as saying.\\n \\n Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. A merger between MCI and Qwest would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October. Last week, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. Competition has intensified and fixed-line phone providers such as MCI and AT&T have seen themselves overtaken by rivals. Buying MCI would give Qwest, a local phone service provider, access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers. MCI also offers internet services.\\n \\n MCI was renamed after it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April last year. It hit the headlines as Worldcom in 2002 after admitting it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. The scandal was a key factor in a global slide in share prices and the reverberations are still being felt today. Shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud.\\n\",\n",
       " 'BT offers equal access to rivals\\n \\n BT has moved to pre-empt a possible break-up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals.\\n \\n The move comes after telecom regulator Ofcom said in November that the firm must offer competitors \"real equality of access to its phone lines\". At the time, Ofcom offered BT the choice of change or splitting into two. Ofcom is carrying out a strategic review aimed at promoting greater competition in the UK telecom sector. BT\\'s competitors have frequently accused it of misusing its status as the former telecoms monopoly and controller of access to many customers to favour its own retail arm.\\n \\n This latest submission was delivered to the watchdog ahead of a deadline for the second phase of its review.\\n \\n \"Central to the proposals are plans by BT to offer operators lower wholesale prices, faster broadband services and transparent, highly-regulated access to BT\\'s local network,\" the former monopoly said in a statement. \"The United Kingdom has the opportunity to create the most exciting and innovative telecoms market in the world,\" BT chief executive Ben Verwaayen said. \"BT has a critical role to play, and today we are making a set of far-reaching proposals towards that framework,\" he said. BT wants lighter regulation in exchange for the changes, as well as the removal of the break-up threat.\\n \\n The group is to set up a new Access Services division - with a separate board which would include independent members - to ensure equal access for rivals to the \"local loop\", the copper wires that run between telephone exchanges and households. The company also unveiled plans to cut the wholesale prices of its most popular broadband product by about 8% from April in areas of high customer demand.\\n \\n It added that it plans to invest Â£10bn in the next five years to create a \"21st Century network\". To meet the growing demand for greater bandwidth, BT said it would begin trials in April with a view to launching higher-speed services nationally from the autumn.\\n \\n Telecom analysts Ovum welcomed the move, saying BT had \"given a lot of ground\".\\n \\n \"The big question now is whether the industry, and particularly Ofcom feels BT\\'s proposals go far enough ...Now the real negotiation begins,\" director of telecoms research Tony Lavender said. Internet service provider (ISP) Plus.net also backed the proposals saying \"we will be entirely happy if Ofcom accepts them\". \"BT has been challenged to play fair and its plans will introduce a level playing field. The scenario now is how well people execute their business plans as a service provider,\" chief executive Lee Strafford said. Chris Panayis, managing director of ISP Freedom2surf said that it would make the situation clearer for business. \"I think it\\'s the first productive thing we\\'ve had from BT,\" he said.\\n \\n AOL backed the price cuts but said regulation was still needed to ensure a level playing field. \"This is a reminder to Ofcom that as long as BT can change the dynamics of the whole broadband market at will, the process of opening up the UK\\'s local telephone network to infrastructure investment and competition remains fragile,\" a spokesman said. \"Ofcom needs to return to regulation of the wholesale broadband service [IPStream] and provide more robust rules for local loop unbundling if consumers are to see the benefits of increased competition and infrastructure investment.\" More than 100 telecom firms, consumer groups and other interested parties are expected to make submissions to the regulator during this consultation phase. Ofcom is expected to spend the next few weeks examining the proposals before making an announcement within the next few months.\\n',\n",

The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November\\'s Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year\\'s election. However, when adding December and January\\'s figures, the administration\\'s first term jobs record ended in positive territory.\\n \\n The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.\\n \\n Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. \"It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,\" said Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group. \"We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment.\" \"The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,\" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. \"That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.\"\\n',\n",

Santa Monica-based Activison is said to be one firm on its takeover list. Video games are \"big business\", the paper quoted Mr Chernin as saying. We \"would like to get into it\".\\n \\n The success of products such as Sony\\'s Playstation, Microsoft\\'s X-Box and Nintendo\\'s Game Cube have boosted demand for video games. The days of arcade classics such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man and Donkey Kong are long gone. Today, games often have budgets big enough for feature films and look to give gamers as real an experience as possible. And with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies, video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun.\\n \\n Mr Chernin, however, told the FT that News Corp was finding it difficult to identify a suitable target. \"We are struggling with the gap between companies like Electronic Arts (EA), which comes with a high price tag, and the next tier of companies,\" he explained during a conference in Phoenix, Arizona. \"These may be too focused on one or two product lines.\" Activision has a stock market capitalisation of about $2.95bn (Â£1.57bn), compared to EA\\'s $17.8bn. Some of the games industry\\'s main players have recently been looking to consolidate their position by making acquisitions. France\\'s Ubisoft, one of Europe\\'s biggest video game publishers, has been trying to remain independent since Electronic Arts announced plans to buy 19.9% of the firm. Analysts have said that industry mergers are likely in the future.\\n',\n",
       " 'Call to overhaul UK state pension\\n \\n The UK pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by a leading retirement think-tank.\\n \\n The Pensions Policy Institute (PPI) said replacing the state pension with a \"citizen\\'s pension\" would help tackle inequality and complexity. The change would see pensions being calculated on length of residency in the UK rather than National Insurance (NI) contributions. Reform could reduce poverty by aiding people with broken employment records.\\n \\n The PPI added that once the state system was reformed the government should look at options to overhaul private and workplace pensions. The think tank\\'s proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the Pensions Commission\\'s initial report into UK retirement savings. According to the Pensions Commission\\'s report 12 million working people are not saving enough for their retirement. As a result, living standards could fall for the next generation of UK pensioners. The report added that a combination of higher taxes, higher savings and/or a higher average retirement age was needed to solve the UK pension crisis.\\n',\n",

However, a slower-than-expected fourth quarter points to more modest growth for the trade-driven economy in 2005 as global technology demand falls back. Slowdowns in the US and China could hit electronics exports, while the tsunami disaster may effect the service sector.\\n \\n Economic growth is set to halve in Singapore this year to between 3% and 5%. In the fourth quarter, the city state\\'s gross domestic product (GDP) rose at an annual rate of 2.4%. That was up from the third quarter, when it fell 3.0%, but was well below analyst forecasts. \"I am surprised at the weak fourth quarter number. The main drag came from electronics,\" said Lian Chia Liang, economist at JP Morgan Chase. Singapore\\'s economy had contracted over the summer, weighed down by soaring oil prices. The economy\\'s poor performance in the July to September period followed four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth as Singapore bounced back strongly from the effects of the deadly Sars virus in 2003.\\n',\n",
       " 'Turkey knocks six zeros off lira\\n \\n Turkey is to relaunch its currency on Saturday, knocking six zeros off the lira in the hope of boosting trade and powering its growing economy.\\n \\n The change will see the end of such dizzyingly-high denominations as five million lira - enough for a short taxi ride - and the 20m note, worth $15. These valuations were the product of decades of inflation which, as recently as 2001, was as high as 70%. Inflation has since been tamed and economic prospects are improving.\\n \\n The currency - officially to be known as the new lira - will be launched at midnight on 1 January. From that point, the one-million lira note will become the new one-lira coin. The government hopes the change will be seen as a promise of growing economic stability as Turkey embarks on the long process of trying to join the European Union.\\n \\n On an everyday level, it is hoped the change will stimulate more international trade and end confusion among foreign investors and Turks alike. \"The transition to the new Turkish lira shows clearly that our economy has broken the vicious circle that it was imprisoned in for long years,\" said Sureyya Serdengecti, head of the Turkish Central Bank. \"The new lira is also the symbol of the stable economy that we dreamed of for long years.\"\\n \\n The Turkish economy teetered on the brink of collapse in 2001 when the lira plunged in value and two million people lost their jobs.\\n \\n Turkey had to turn to the International Monetary Fund for financial assistance, accepting a $18bn loan in return for pushing through a wide-ranging austerity programme. These tough measures have borne fruit. Inflation fell below 10% earlier this year for the first time in decades while exports are up 30% this year. Meanwhile, the economy is expanding at a healthy rate, with 7.9% growth expected in 2004. The government hopes that the new currency will cement the country\\'s economic progress, two weeks after EU leaders set a date for the start of Turkey\\'s accession talks.\\n \\n The slimmed-down lira is likely to be widely welcomed by the business community.\\n \\n \"The Turkish lira has been like funny money,\" Tevfik Aksoy, chief Turkish economist for Deutsche Bank, told Associated Press. \"Now at least in cosmetic terms it will look like real currency.\" However, some do not feel quite so happy about seeing the nominal value of their investments reduced. \"If a person has 10 billion lira in investments this will suddenly decrease,\" shop owner Hayriye Evren, told Associated Press. \"This will definitely affect people psychologically.\"\\n',\n",

The government\\'s main problems are \"slumping consumption and a contraction in the construction industry\". It aims to create 400,000 jobs and will focus on infrastructure and home building, as well as providing public firms with money to hire new workers.\\n \\n The government has set an economic growth rate target of 5% for next year and hinted that would be in danger unless it took action. \"Internal and external economic conditions are likely to remain unfavourable in 2005,\" the Finance and Economy Ministry said in a statement.\\n \\n It blamed \"continuing uncertainties such as fluctuating oil prices and foreign exchange rates and stagnant domestic demand that has shown few signs of a quick rebound\". In 2004, growth will be between 4.7% and 4.8%, the ministry said. Not everyone is convinced the plan will work. \"Our primary worry centres on the what we believe is the government\\'s overly optimistic view that its front loading of the budget will be enough to turn the economy around,\" consultancy 4Cast said in a report.\\n \\n The problem facing South Korea is that many consumers are reeling from the effects of a credit bubble that only recently burst. Millions of South Koreans are defaulting on their credit card bills, and the country\\'s biggest card lender has been hovering on the verge of bankruptcy for months. As part of its spending plans, the government said it will ask firms to \"roll over mortgage loans that come due in the first half of 2005\" . It also pledged to look at ways of helping families on low incomes.\\n \\n The government voiced concern about the effect of redundancies in the building trade. \"Given the economic spill over and employment effect in the construction sector, a sharp downturn in the construction industry could have other adverse effects,\" the ministry said.\\n \\n As a result, South Korea will give private companies also will be given the chance to build schools, hospitals, houses and other public buildings. It also will look at real estate tax system. Other plans on the table include promoting new industries such as bio-technology and nano-technology, as well as offering increased support to small and medium sized businesses. \"The focus will be on job creation and economic recovery, given that unfavourable domestic and global conditions are likely to dog the Korean economy in 2005,\" the ministry said.\\n',\n",
       " \"Latin America sees strong growth\\n \\n Latin America's economy grew by 5.5% in 2004, its best performance since 1980, while exports registered their best performance in two decades.\\n \\n The United Nations' Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean said the region grew by 5.5% this year. The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) said regional exports reached $445.1bn (Â£227bn;331bn euros) in 2004. Doubts about the strength of the US recovery and overheating of the Chinese economy do however pose risks for 2005. Both organisations also warned that high oil prices raise the risk of either inflation or recession.\\n \\n Nevertheless, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) still forecasts growth of 4% for 2005. Strong recovery in some countries, such as Venezuela and Uruguay, boosted the overall performance of the region. ECLAC also said that the six largest Latin American economies (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) grew by more than 3% for only the second time in 20 years. Chinese and US economic strength helped boost exports, as did strong demand for agricultural and mining products. In fact, Latin American exports to China grew 34%, to $14bn. Higher oil prices also helped boost exports, as Mexico and Venezuela are important oil exporters. Regional blocs as well as free trade agreements with the US contributed to the region's strong performance, the IADB said.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Asia shares defy post-quake gloom\\n \\n Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.\\n \\n Investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia\\'s listed firms. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,\" said ABN Amro\\'s Eddie Wong. \"[But] it\\'s not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.\"\\n \\n India\\'s Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka\\'s stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\\n \\n Thailand may lose 30bn baht (Â£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\\n \\n In the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry\\'s fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won\\'t be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.\\n \\n However, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. \"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. \"The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Booming markets shed few tears\\n \\n The market, former British government minister Michael Heseltine once said, has no morality.\\n \\n And indeed, stock exchange traders around Asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week\\'s disaster. Stock markets in Indonesia and India have hit all-time highs this week; even in Sri Lanka, more comprehensively affected, the main index has lost only 5% since the waves hit. Bigger markets further afield have barely twitched. The MSCI World share index, a measure of global stock market performance, hit its highest level this week since early 2001; the BBC Global 30 has risen by 3% in the past week. And this at a time when - all sentiment aside - insurance costs are already estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, and countries around the region are looking at trimming their growth forecasts.\\n \\n In fact, the markets are being perfectly rational.\\n \\n For a start, the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines. The overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance: according to estimates from India, only one-quarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance, and only one-quarter of that group at most will have taken out policies. Indonesia is likely to have even lower take-up rates. And where insurance certainly is in place - in, for example, the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market, rather than landing locally.\\n \\n Second, stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged. Most of the biggest companies traded on the soaring Jakarta Stock Exchange are in oil, technology and financial services - none of which have been hit by the flooding. Tourist businesses, the most likely sufferers, are either foreign-owned or too small to have their shares listed. Those that are listed have suffered: Confifi Hotel Holdings, a small Sri Lankan tourism firm, has halved in value this week. But there are winners as well as losers. Asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies, many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities. In Indonesia, shares in state construction companies Adhi Karya and Semen Gresik have jumped sharply this week.\\n \\n More broadly, the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact.\\n \\n According to the Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center at Colorado State University, there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by a depression. The need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity; there is rarely, the centre says, any sort of rebuilding boom, but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided. A study of the 1993 Des Moines floods, from the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware*, found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster, and another 18% felt themselves better off. \"Although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale, our research indicates that most businesses, even those that are especially hard-hit, do indeed recover,\" the authors concluded.\\n \\n But disasters have a vast psychological impact, and markets are driven by psychological factors.\\n \\n In particular, many analysts warn of panic spreading unchecked through the global financial system, as investors seek to cover themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unguessable events. In fact, again, the risks here are lower than they seem. Even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $30 trillion and rising. A series of recent shocks, the Colorado centre has argued, have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens: market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps, and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets. The trillion-dollar debts of Japan\\'s banks, for example, have had no effect on stock markets further afield than Tokyo. And the US stock market was on its way down long before 11 September, 2001; it rose by 20% during the six months following the attacks. \"It is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings,\" one Bombay trader said this week. \"But the reaction would have been seen if business had been affected. Business sense probably tends to overrule everything else.\"\\n',\n",

Reisurance firms such as Swiss Re and Munich Re lost value as investors worried about rebuilding costs. But the disaster has little impact on stock markets in the US and Asia.\\n \\n Currencies including the Thai baht and Indonesian rupiah weakened as analysts warned that economic growth may slow. \"It came at the worst possible time,\" said Hans Goetti, a Singapore-based fund manager. \"The impact on the tourist industry is pretty devastating, especially in Thailand.\" Travel-related shares dropped in Europe, with companies such as Germany\\'s TUI and Lufthansa and France\\'s Club Mediterranne sliding. Insurers and reinsurance firms were also under pressure in Europe.\\n \\n Shares in Munich Re and Swiss Re - the world\\'s two biggest reinsurers - both fell 1.7% as the market speculated about the cost of rebuilding in Asia. Zurich Financial, Allianz and Axa also suffered a decline in value.\\n \\n However, their losses were much smaller, reflecting the market\\'s view that reinsurers were likely to pick up the bulk of the costs. Worries about the size of insurance liabilities dragged European shares down, although the impact was exacerbated by light post-Christmas trading. Germany\\'s benchmark Dax index closed the day 16.29 points lower at 3.817.69 while France\\'s Cac index of leading shares fell 5.07 points to 3.817.69. Investors pointed out, however, that declines probably would be industry specific, with the travel and insurance firms hit hardest. \"It\\'s still too early for concrete damage figures,\" Swiss Re\\'s spokesman Floiran Woest told Associated Press. \"That also has to do with the fact that the damage is very widely spread geographically.\"\\n \\n The unfolding scale of the disaster in south Asia had little immediate impact on US shares, however. The Dow Jones index had risen 20.54 points, or 0.2%, to 10,847.66 by late morning as analsyts were cheered by more encouraging reports from retailers about post-Christmas sales. In Asian markets, adjustments were made quickly to account for lower earnings and the cost of repairs. Thai Airways shed almost 4%. The country relies on tourism for about 6% of its total economy. Singapore Airlines dropped 2.6%. About 5% of Singapore\\'s annual gross domestic product (GDP) comes from tourism. Malaysia\\'s budget airline, AirAsia fell 2.9%. Resort operator Tanco Holdings slumped 5%.\\n \\n Travel companies also took a hit, with Japan\\'s Kinki Nippon sliding 1.5% and HIS dropping 3.3%. However, the overall impact on Asia\\'s largest stock market, Japan\\'s Nikkei, was slight. Shares fell just 0.03%. Concerns about the strength of economic growth going forward weighed on the currency markets. The Indonesian rupiah lost as much as 0.6% against the US dollar, before bouncing back slightly to trade at 9,300. The Thai baht lost 0.3% against the US currency, trading at 39.10. In India, where more than 2,000 people are thought to have died, the rupee shed 0.1% against the dollar Analysts said that it was difficult to predict the total cost of the disaster and warned that share prices and currencies would come under increasing pressure as the bills mounted.\\n',\n",

Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. But when the stock market collapsed in 2000, the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. An estimated 50,000 people took out split-capital funds, some investing their life savings in the schemes. The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said.\\n \\n Further details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year. \"This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome,\" Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News. Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\\n \\n The FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. The FSA\\'s 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called \"magic circle\", in the hope of propping up one another\\'s share prices.\\n \\n Firms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to Â£350m in compensation. Mr McIvor told the BBC that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.\\n',\n",

The German exchange said it had held \"constructive, professional and friendly\" talks with the LSE. But Euronext declined to comment after the talks ended on Friday. Speculation is mounting that the Germans may raise their bid to Â£1.5bn. Deutsche Boerse previously offered Â£1.3bn, which was rejected by the LSE, while Euronext is rumoured to have facilities in place to fund a Â£1.4bn cash bid. So far, however, neither have tabled a formal bid. But a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange.\\n \\n There was speculation Euronext would use Friday\\'s meeting as an opportunity to take advantage of growing disquiet over Deutsche Boerse\\'s own plans for dominance over the London market. Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt has reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful. \"The works council has expressed concerns that the equities and derivatives trade could be managed from London in the future,\" Reuters news agency reports a union source as saying. German politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator\\'s promise to move its headquarters to London if a bid were successful.\\n \\n Meanwhile, LSE shareholders fear that Deutsche Boerse\\'s control over its Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions - would create a monopoly situation. This would weaken the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. LSE and Euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations, a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive. The German group\\'s ownership of Clearstream has been seen as the main stumbling block to a London-Frankfurt merger. Commentators believe Deutsche Boerse, which has now formally asked German authorities to approve its plan to buy the LSE, may offer to sell Clearstream to gain shareholder approval. Euronext, so far, has given little away as to what sweeteners it will offer the LSE - Europe\\'s biggest equity market - into a deal.\\n',\n",
       " \"Troubled Marsh under SEC scrutiny\\n \\n The US stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker Marsh & McLennan's shareholder transactions, the firm has said.\\n \\n The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of 5% or more of the firm's shares. Marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the SEC investigation. Marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the New York attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market. Since that inquiry was launched in October, Marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board. Prosecutors allege that Marsh - the world's biggest insurance broker - and other US insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover. This is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by New York's top law officer, Eliot Spitzer, and a separate prosecution of five insurers by the State of California. The SEC's investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the Trident Funds, managed by MMC Capital, the company's private equity firm. Marsh's new chief executive, Michael Cherkasky, is trying to negotiate a settlement with Mr Spitzer. Mr Spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner against corporate America's misdeeds.\\n \\n The uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch - to downgrade Marsh in recent weeks. According to the Financial Times, insurance analysts are now questioning whether Marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year. Doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Could Yukos be a blessing in disguise?\\n \\n Other things being equal, the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business.\\n \\n But in the looking-glass world of modern Russia, the opposite might just be true, a new report* has argued. The study, from the Centre for Economic Policy Research, does not praise the rough handling of oil company Yukos. But it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all Russian firms, even targets of the tax police. \"An increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,\" the authors say.\\n \\n The paper\\'s reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company. The calculations demonstrated what many Russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. In the West, meanwhile, higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. On the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. The net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.\\n \\n After Vladimir Putin became president in 2000, he did not raise taxes, but put a lot of effort - too much, critics argue - into enforcement.\\n \\n Since then, the Russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. The report highlights the case of Sibneft, a Russian oil company that came close to merging with Yukos last year. After Mr Putin came to power, the company\\'s overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4%, and Sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. But shareholders benefited hugely: Sibneft started to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. According to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through Russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at Sibneft and many of its peers.\\n \\n Does this analysis make sense? In part, certainly. For all its faults, corporate Russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000. Companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards. Foreign direct investment, long negligible, is starting to flow in serious amounts - $7bn in 2003 - and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in Europe. But the authors\\' model does not quite cover all the complexities. For a start, the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit, governments want to maximise tax revenue. In fact, the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in Russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. Companies can, for example, persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes.\\n \\n And the authors\\' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically Western. Genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in Russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced. The case against Yukos, for example, has moved in fits and starts, with little clarity from the government about its intentions, and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. As far as most commentators are concerned, the state is pursuing Yukos out of a political vendetta, rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. Since Yukos\\' founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested a year ago, the Russian market has dropped by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.\\n',\n",
       " 'Nasdaq planning $100m share sale\\n \\n The owner of the technology-dominated Nasdaq stock index plans to sell shares to the public and list itself on the market it operates.\\n \\n According to a registration document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nasdaq Stock Market plans to raise $100m (Â£52m) from the sale. Some observers see this as another step closer to a full public listing. However Nasdaq, an icon of the 1990s technology boom, recently poured cold water on those suggestions.\\n \\n The company first sold shares in private placements during 2000 and 2001. It technically went public in 2002 when the stock started trading on the OTC Bulletin Board, which lists equities that trade only occasionally. Nasdaq will not make money from the sale, only investors who bought shares in the private placings, the filing documents said. The Nasdaq is made up shares in technology firms and other companies with high growth potential. It was the most potent symbol of the 1990s internet and telecoms boom, nose-diving after the bubble burst. A recovery in the fortunes of tech giants such as Intel, and dot.com survivors such as Amazon has helped revive its fortunes.\\n',\n",
       " 'Giving financial gifts to children\\n \\n Your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this Christmas, but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future?\\n \\n Gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact. It may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs, for example.\\n \\n The government is trying to encourage saving at an early age, through its new Child Trust Fund. The first vouchers, worth Â£250 or Â£500 for low-income families, will be distributed from January. All children born after 1st September 2002 will be eligible. Parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in April 2005.\\n \\n Parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to Â£1,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax. As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children\\'s deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund.\\n \\n There are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest. Some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the Ladybird account from the Saffron Walden Building Society, paying 5.35% for a minimum balance of Â£1 and the Alliance & Leicester FirstSaver which pays 5.25%, also starting at Â£1.\\n \\n Interest earned by children is subject to income tax. However, children, like adults, have a personal income tax allowance (Â£4,745 for the current tax year).\\n \\n If the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. As long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance, then no tax will be payable. When the account is opened a form \"R85\", available from the bank or building society, should be completed. This confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.\\n \\n The tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child. Only Â£100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free. Where interest exceeds this level, the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. This is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children\\'s names and taking advantage of the tax allowances. Where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child, consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents\\' gifts and one for gifts from other relatives. Therefore, it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the Child Trust Fund which is tax free, with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual Â£1,200 limit being directed to a deposit account.\\n \\n Another favourite solution is Premium Bonds. With the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account, they make great presents. The parent or guardian will be responsible for the Bonds and will receive notification of the purchase. Any prizes will be sent to the parent or child\\'s guardian. The minimum for each purchase is Â£100 and Bonds are sold in multiples of Â£10.\\n \\n There are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored.\\n \\n Over the longer term, stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment, although in the shorter term they can be volatile. One of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares. One way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust. These are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares. These funds may be actively managed, where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential, or passive, where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index, for example, the FTSE 100. Exchange Traded Funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market. These are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker). The difference is that the charges are quite low. The only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18, and parents will have no control over how it is spent. For larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income.\\n',\n",

Share trading will begin on 15 December, the LSE said. For China\\'s aviation authorities, the listing is part of the modernisation of its airline sector to cope with soaring demand for air travel. No further details of the share price or number of shares were given.\\n \\n The LSE has been working hard to woo Chinese companies to choose London, rather than New York for their listings. It opened an Asia-Pacific office in Hong Kong last month. \"We are delighted that Air China has chosen London for its listing outside China,\" said LSE chief executive Clara Furse. \"The London Stock Exchange offers ambitious Chinese companies access to the world\\'s most international equity market combined with high regulatory and corporate governance standards,\" she said. A spokesman for the LSE said: \"We\\'ve been engaged with them (Air China) for about 18 months, two years now.\" As part of its pitch to bring listings to London, the LSE is thought to be highlighting the extra costs and red-tape imposed by new US laws passed since the Enron scandal, whilst stressing London\\'s strong regulatory environment.\\n \\n Germany\\'s Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder began a three-day visit to Beijing on Monday by signing a deal worth 1bn euros ($1.3bn; Â£690m) for Airbus to sell 23 new planes to Air China, the Deutsche Welle radio station reported. China\\'s booming economy has created huge demand for air travel among middle-class Chinese, turning the country into a sales battleground between rival plane makers Airbus and Boeing. Air China\\'s long-awaited flotation is part of a strategy to modernise a dozen state-owned carriers, which have been reorganised into three groups under Air China, China Southern and China Eastern. Merrill Lynch are sole bookrunners for Air China\\'s flotation, which will take the form of a share placing with institutional investors in London, though retail investors may be able to buy Air China shares in Hong Kong. Air China\\'s primary listing will be in Hong Kong, with a secondary listing in London. The shares will be denominated in Hong Kong dollars. However, investors may be wary of Chinese stocks. The collapse last week of China Aviation Oil, the Singapore-listed arm of a Chinese jet fuel trader, has cast the spotlight on corporate governance shortcomings at Chinese firms.\\n',\n",
       " 'Oil prices reach three-month low\\n \\n Oil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three-month lows after news that US crude stocks have improved ahead of winter.\\n \\n London Brent crude closed at $40.15 on Thursday - a drop of 5.1% - having dived below $40 a barrel for the first time since mid-September. US light crude traded in New York lost more than $2 to $43.25, its lowest close since 10 September. The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days. The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices. \"It\\'s amazing how quickly sentiment changed,\" said Rick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis. Analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil.\\n \\n The stronger fuel inventories helped boost US stock markets to nine-month highs on Wednesday, though only the Nasdaq index had hung onto those gains by the end of Thursday.\\n \\n In London, the FTSE 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. However, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.\\n \\n The price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October. Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September. Traders were also encouraged by comments on Wednesday from the energy minister of Opec member Algeria. Chakib Khelil said the cartel was likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week. However, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec\\'s attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output.\\n \\n Fears still remain over the level of US heating oil stocks, which are rising but remain down on 2004 levels. A cold spell in north America would start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises. Analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise. \"Mother Nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks,\" said Kyle Cooper, at Citigroup Global Markets. \"Long term I think we\\'re headed to $30-35 but I don\\'t think we\\'re doing that yet. We have a lot of winter left.\" John Person, president of National Futures Advisory Services, said the EIA data indicated there should be adequate supplies for the next three months in the US. .\\n',\n",
       " 'Arsenal \\'may seek full share listing\\'\\n \\n Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange.\\n \\n Speaking at the Soccerex football business forum in Dubai, he said a full listing was \"one of the options\" for funding after the club moves to its new stadium. The club - which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 2006/07 season. Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season.\\n \\n When Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years\\' time. The club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover, and has not ruled out other money-earning means, including a full share listing. \"When the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review,\" Mr Dein said.\\n \\n \"Listing would be one option, but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet. \"We want to be in the best financial health - maybe clubs can do it (listing), Manchester United have been a success.\"\\n \\n Mr Dein said that, although television money and coverage had driven the English game forward in the past 10 years, he feared there might now be too many games being shown. Since the formation of the Premier League in season 1992/93, Premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar. \"Television has been the driving force over the past 10 years... but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world\\'s leading league competition. \"We must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline, and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on TV too. \"I think we have practically reached saturation point... sometimes I think less is more.\"\\n \\n The club is funding its move to Ashburton Grove through a number of sources, including debt from banks, from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors, and from the sale of surplus property, including its Highbury Stadium. It is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets, including Asia. \"We have two executives travelling round Japan and China at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs, and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too, as they are around the world. \"We have got a very good product, so it is very important we go and look at these markets, and make sure we are on the case.\"\\n',\n",

The market\\'s buoyancy reflects optimism about the Brazilian economy, which could grow by as much as 4.5% in 2004. Brazil is recovering from last year\\'s recession - its worst in a decade.\\n \\n Economic output declined 0.2% in 2003 and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva - elected as Brazil\\'s first working-class president in 2002 - was strongly criticised for pursuing a hardline economic policy.\\n \\n Investors have praised his handling of the economy as foreign investment has risen, unemployment has fallen and inflation has been brought under control. Analysts believe the stock market will rise above the 25,000 mark for the first time before too long. \"There should be more space for gains until the end of the year, somewhere up to 27,000 points,\" said Paschoal Tadeu Buonomo, head of equities trading at brokers TOV. Brazil\\'s currency, the real, also rose to its highest level against the dollar in more than two years on Friday. Although interest rates still stand at a punitive 17.25%, inflation has fallen from 9% to 7% while exports are booming, particularly of agricultural products. \"For the first time in decades, we have all three economic policy pillars in line during a recovery,\" Finance Minister Antonio Palocci told the Associated Press news agency. \"Government accounts are in surplus, we have a current account surplus and inflation is under control.\"\\n \\n Investors were deeply suspicious of President da Silva, a former trade union leader who campaigned on a programme of extensive land redistribution and a large rise in the minimum wage. However, Mr da Silva has stuck to an orthodox monetary policy inherited from his predecessor even in the face of last year\\'s economic crisis. This has earned him the disapproval of rural farm workers, thousands of whom who took to the streets of Brasilia on Thursday to protest against government policies. President da Silva has defended his policies, arguing that Brazil cannot afford to continue the cycle of boom and bust which afflicted it in recent decades.\\n',\n",
       " 'Markets fall on weak dollar fears\\n \\n Rising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on Monday after a finance ministers\\' meeting and stern words from Fed chief Alan Greenspan.\\n \\n The London FTSE fell 0.8% while Tokyo\\'s Nikkei 225 dropped 2.11%, its steepest fall in three months. G20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in Japan and Europe. And Mr Greenspan warned Asian states could soon stop funding the US deficit.\\n \\n On Monday afternoon, the euro was close to an all-time high against the dollar at above $1.30. Oil pushed higher too on Monday, as investors fretted about cold weather in the US and Europe and a potential output cut from oil producers\\' group Opec, although prices had cooled by the end of the day. In London, the benchmark Brent crude price closed down 51 cents at $44.38 a barrel, while New York light sweet crude closed down 25 cents at $48.64 a barrel. The slide comes as the US has been attempting to talk up the traditional \"strong dollar\" policy.\\n \\n The latest to pitch in has been President George W Bush himself, who told the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Chile that he remained committed to halving the budget deficit. Together with a $500bn trade gap, the red ink spreading across America\\'s public finances is widely seen as a key factor driving the dollar lower. And last week US Treasury Secretary John Snow told an audience in the UK that the policy remained unaltered. But he also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets - a signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar. Some had looked to the G20 meeting for direction. But Mr Snow made clear exchange rates had not been on the agenda.\\n \\n For the US government, letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term fix.\\n \\n US exports get more affordable, helping perhaps to close the trade gap. In the meantime, the debt keeps getting bigger, with Congress authorising an $800bn rise in what the US can owe - taking the total to $8.2 trillion. But in a speech on Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky. At present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to Asian states such as Japan and China, since the dollar is seen as the world\\'s reserve currency. Similarly, Asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the US as a whole spends and what it earns. But already they are turning more cautious - an auction of debt in August found few takers. And Mr Greenspan said that could turn into a trend, if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the value of those investments. \"It seems persuasive that, given the size of the US current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point,\" he said.\\n',\n",

In one of the most closely-watched initial public offerings in stock market history, the US-based company sold 19.6 million shares at $85 each. Google shares have risen since but fell $12.33 on Tuesday to close at $172.55. The restriction - known as a lockup - is being eased piecemeal: in all, some 227 million additional shares will become free to trade by February 2005. Selling the shares could turn many of Google's workers into millionaires.\\n \\n There were fears that the potential increase of shares in circulation from Tuesday would ease demand for stock. However, analysts say they expected most shareholders would be holding back from selling all their shares immediately, as Google's good performance and future growth potential means demand will hold.\\n \\n In its first earnings report since floating on the stock market, Google said it made a net profit of $52m in the three months ending 30 September. Sales surged to $805.9m in the third quarter, up from $393.9m a year earlier. Google's main service - its internet search - is free to users, so the firm makes much of its money from selling advertising space linked to the words for which its users search. It also sells the use of its technology to companies who need to make either their websites, or their internal information systems, searchable.\\n\",\n",

Unemployment has not been this high in Germany since the 1930s.\\n \\n Changes to the way the statistics are compiled partly explain the jump of 572,900 in the numbers. But the figures are embarrassing for the government. \"With the figures apparently the worst we\\'ve seen in the post-war period, these numbers are very charged politically,\" said Christian Jasperneite, an economist with MM Warburg. \"They could well put an end to the recent renaissance we\\'ve seen by the SPD [the ruling Social Democrats] in the polls, and with state elections due in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, they may have an adverse effect on the government\\'s chances there.\"\\n \\n The opposition also made political capital from the figures. It said there are a further 1.5 million-2 million people on subsidised employment schemes who are, in fact, looking for real jobs. It added that government reforms, including unpopular benefit cuts, do not go far enough. Under the government\\'s controversial \"Hartz IV\" reforms, which came into effect at the beginning of the year, both those on unemployment benefits and welfare support and those who are long-term unemployed are officially classified as looking for work. The bad winter weather also took its toll, as key sectors such as the construction sector laid off workers. Adjusted for the seasonal factors, the German jobless total rose by 227,000 in January from December.\\n',\n",

It was India\\'s second $1bn stock debut in three months, coming after the flotation by software firm Tata. The share offer was eleven times oversubscribed. \"It is a good investment bet,\" said Suhas Naik, an investment analyst from ING Mutual Fund. \"Power needs in India are set to rise and NTPC will benefit from that.\" Analysts say the success of the NTPC flotation would encourage the government to reduce stakes in more power companies. NTPC has said it will use the money from the share sale to feed the growing needs of the country\\'s energy-starved economy. The firm is the largest utility company in India, and the sixth largest power producer in the world.\\n',\n",
       " 'Turkey turns on the economic charm\\n \\n Three years after a gruelling economic crisis, Turkey has dressed its economy to impress.\\n \\n As part of a charm offensive - ahead of 17 December, when the European Union will decide whether to start entry talks - Turkey\\'s economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements. The economy is growing fast, they insist. Education levels among its young and large population are rising. Unemployment levels, in percentage terms, are heading fast towards single digits. Inflation is under control. A new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards. The tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to $21bn (Â£10.8bn) in three years.\\n \\n Moreover, government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled. Income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract $15bn of foreign investment over the next three years. A loan restructuring deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is pretty much in the can. And following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts, its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent.\\n \\n The point of all this has been to convince Europe\\'s decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the EU, allowing Turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits.\\n \\n \"The cake will be bigger for everybody,\" said Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener earlier this month. \"Turkey will not be a burden for the EU budget.\" If admitted into the EU, Turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros ($8bn; Â£6bn) to its budget by 2014, according to a recent impact study by the country\\'s State Planning Organisation. As Turkey\\'s gross domestic output (GDP) is set to grow by 6% per year on average, its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020. Turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in \"Old Europe\" once its population comes of age. By 2014, one in four Turks - or about 18 million people - will be aged 14 or less. \"A literate and qualified Turkish population,\" insisted Mr Sener, \"will make a positive impact on the EU.\"\\n \\n This runs contrary to the popular view that Turkey is getting ready to dig deep into EU taxpayers\\' wallets. However, Turkey\\'s assertions are confirmed by Brussels\\' own impact studies, which indeed say that Turkish membership would be good news for the EU economy. But only over time. Costs are projected to be vast during the early years of Turkey\\'s membership, with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and, according to some predictions, balloon to 33.5bn euros. This would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid, though such payments should decline as the country\\'s farm sector, which currently employs one in three Turks, would employ just one in five by 2020.\\n \\n Such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by Turkey\\'s government would never be delivered, say those who feel the Turkish project should be shunned.\\n \\n Some fear that rather than providing an educated, sophisticated labour force for Europe at large, the people who will leave Turkey to seek work abroad will be poor, uneducated - and plentiful. More recently, less palatable concerns - at least in liberal European circles - have been voiced, with senior EU or member state officials talking darkly of a \"river of Islam\", an \"oriental\" culture and a threat to Europe\\'s \"cultural richness\". Of course, many opponents are politically motivated - their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country\\'s Muslim traditions to well-documented concerns about the government\\'s human rights record. Yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand.\\n \\n Critics insist that much of the optimism about Turkey\\'s economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a 134% rise in the country\\'s current account deficit to $10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year.\\n \\n The country\\'s massive debt - which includes $23bn owed to the IMF and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the EU. \"In the new member states of the European Union, gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product,\" says Reza Moghadam, assistant director of the IMF\\'s European Department. \"At about 80% of GDP, Turkey\\'s gross debt is double that figure.\" Turkey\\'s debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country\\'s devastating recession. \"There is no question that although Turkey is doing much better than in the past, it remains quite vulnerable,\" says Michael Deppler, director of the IMF\\'s European Department. \"Its debt is far too high for an emerging economy.\" A key factor for EU decision makers should be whether or not Turkey has met its economic criteria. But economics is not a science. And although the state of Turkey\\'s economy is important, as is its pace of reform, the final decision on 17 December will be taken by politicians who will, of course, be guided by their political instincts.\\n',\n",

Another 1,700 will go from its sales department, 3,400 from business operations and 2,600 across legal, advertising and public relations. SBC currently employs 163,000 people while AT&T employs 47,000. The takeover was announced on Monday. The deal will be financed with $15bn of shares as well as a $1bn special dividend paid to AT&T shareholders.\\n \\n It effectively marks the end of AT&T, which was founded in 1875 by telephone pioneer Alexander Graham Bell and is one of the US's best-known companies. SBC and AT&T said estimated cost savings of at least $2bn from 2008 were a main driver for the merger. AT&T is a long-distance telecoms firm, while SBC is mainly focused on the local market in the western US. Both also have data network businesses. The takeover is subject to approval by AT&T's shareholders and regulators. The companies said they expected to complete the agreement during the first half of 2006.\\n\",\n",

However, rival suitor Euronext also upped the ante in the bid battle. Ahead of talks with the LSE on Friday, the pan-European bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash. The Paris-based exchange, owner of Liffe in London, is reported to be ready to raise Â£1.4bn to fund a bid.\\n \\n The news came as Deutsche Boerse held its third meeting with the LSE since its bid approach in December which was turned down by the London exchange for undervaluing the business. However, the LSE did agree to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a \"significantly-improved proposal\" would be in the interests of LSE\\'s shareholders and customers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: \"There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made.\" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. However, neither side has made a formal offer for the LSE, with sources claiming such a step may still be weeks away.\\n \\n Deutsche Boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home. Among sweeteners reported to have been discussed by Mr Seifert with Ms Furse were plans to move the management of its cash and Eurex derivatives market to London, as well as two members of its executive board. But, Hans Reckers, a board member of Germany\\'s central bank, the Bundesbank, said that cash trading should also remain in Frankfurt, something Deutsche Boerse could move to the UK. \"It is not just the headquarters of the Boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in Frankfurt. This has special importance for the business activities of the banks and the consultants,\" he said. Local government officials in Frankfurt\\'s state of Hessen have also spoken out against the move. \"It is our wish that the headquarters stay here to maintain Frankfurt\\'s standing as the number one financial centre in continental Europe,\" Alois Rhiel, its minister for economic affairs added.\\n',\n",

AEFA has more than 12,000 advisers selling financial advice, funds and insurance to 2.5 million customers. Over the years it has delivered poor profits and even some losses.\\n \\n \"This is an excellent move by American Express to focus on its core businesses, and sell off a laggard division, which has been a problem for quite some time,\" said Marquis Investment Research analyst Phil Kain. Analysts estimate that a stand-alone AEFA could have a market value of $10bn (Â£5.3bn). The unit was acquired by American Express 20 years ago as Investors Diversified Service, of Minneapolis, at a time when firms were amassing one-stop financial empires. However, the business of selling investments was never integrated with the rest of the group.\\n',\n",

Axa blamed a poor stock market performance for the cut, adding that recent gains have not yet offset the market falls seen in 2001 and 2002. The cut will hit an estimated 3% of Axa\\'s policyholders. The rest will know their fate in March.\\n \\n The cuts on Axa\\'s policies will mean a policyholder who had invested Â£50 a month into an endowment policy for the past 25 years would see a final maturity payout of Â£46,998. This equated to a annual investment growth rate of 8% Axa said. With-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. However, heavy stock market falls throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. \"The stock market has grown over the past 18 months, however not enough to undo the damage that occurred during 2001 and 2002,\" Axa spokesman Mark Hamilton, Axa spokesman, told BBC News. Axa cut payouts for the same investors last January.\\n',\n",

The Xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. The Beijing News said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the Three Gorges Underground Power Plant and the Three Gorges Project Electrical Power Supply Plant.\\n \\n So far, only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by China\\'s State Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order. The China Three Gorges Project Corp could now face a fine up to 200,000 yuan ($24,000; Â£12,700). Last week, it denied that its projects violated regulations. \"The Three Gorges Corporation has all along abided by the law and have built our projects in accordance with the law,\" it said.\\n \\n The Sepa order comes as the Chinese government appears to be trying to cool the country\\'s booming economy. Previously it has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages, which forced many factories into part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6% to 440,700 megawatts (MW). The Xiluodu Dam is designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity, and is being built on the Jinshajiang - or \"river of golden sand\" as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. It is a sister project to the main Three Gorges Dam downstream where more than half a million people have had to be relocated, drawing criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists.\\n',\n",
       " 'Stock market eyes Japan recovery\\n \\n Japanese shares have ended the year at their highest level since 13 July amidst hopes of an economic recovery during 2005.\\n \\n The Nikkei index of leading shares gained 7.6% during the year to close at 11,488.76 points. In 2005 it \"will rise toward 13,000\", predicted Morgan Stanley equity strategist Naoki Kamiyama. The optimism in the financial markets contrast sharply with pessimism in the Japanese business community. Earlier this month, the quarterly Tankan survey of Japanese manufacturers found that business confidence had weakened for the first time since March 2003.\\n \\n Slower economic growth, rising oil prices, a stronger yen and weaker exports were blamed for the fall in confidence. Despite this, traders expect strength in the global economy to benefit Japan, which has been close to sliding into recession in recent months. Structural reform within Japan and an anticipated end to the banking sector\\'s bad debt problems should also help, they say.\\n',\n",
       " 'Iraqi voters turn to economic issues\\n \\n Beyond the desperate security situation in Iraq lies an economy in tatters.\\n \\n A vicious cycle of unemployment, poor social services and poverty has been made worse by a lack of investment. So there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock. \"First rule of law, then the economy,\" says Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003. Mr Hadi\\'s view about what the new government\\'s priorities should be is shared by many Iraqis. The economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of Sunday\\'s election, according to Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq.\\n \\n Job creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the Iraqi people\\'s wish list. Nobody knows exactly how many Iraqis are out of work, but it is clear that the situation is dire. \"Estimates of Iraq\\'s unemployment rate vary, but we estimate it to be between 30-40%,\" the Washington-based independent think-tank The Brookings Institution says in its Iraq Index. But some progress has been made, largely thanks to the country\\'s oil revenues which have exceeded $22bn since June 2003.\\n \\n Iraq\\'s infrastructure is on the mend, with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply, irrigation, telephone networks and the re-opening of hospitals. But serious problems remain and the growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters. One Iraqi woman told Ms Alexander about her frustration as she watched TV adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from Baghdad\\'s pharmacies. Observes Mr Hadi: \"The economy at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer.\" An indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where, in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people, 19 private banks operate, only one of which is run in accordance with Islamic banking principles. Hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into the sector. National Bank of Kuwait has bought a majority stake in Credit Bank of Iraq, the Jordanian investment bank Export & Finance Bank has bought 49% of National Bank of Iraq.\\n \\n Foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort. Bechtel\\'s efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting its bottom line while Halliburton has enjoyed a wealth of military contracts. But the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many Iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes Ms Alexander. \"It is seen as a selling off of Iraq\\'s assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of Iraqi businesses and Iraqi workers,\" she says. Consequently, the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100% foreign ownership of Iraqi assets, she explains. In the West, it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal Baathist regime used to look after the majority of Iraq\\'s citizens rather well in terms of job creation, social security and healthcare. Opinion polls suggest that \"people still want the state to take a leading role in providing these things\", Ms Alexander says.\\n \\n Yet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed, insists Mr Hadi, an Iraqi who left the country three decades ago. \"I think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast,\" Mr Hadi says. \"Iraq\\'s vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth.\"\\n \\n Many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act, yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way. But there are exceptions. Mr Hadi\\'s Blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future. Blackwatch\\'s Baghdad-based affiliate Falcon Group has dozens of people working for it across the country in Kirkuk and Baghdad, and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the Iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, Mr Hadi points out. \"These guys are trying to work. The Iraqi business people will do business at all times. \"Life goes on in Iraq, the people take responsibility, they want to live normal lives.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"EU 'too slow' on economic reforms\\n \\n Most EU countries have failed to put in place policies aimed at making Europe the world's most competitive economy by the end of the decade, a report says.\\n \\n The study, undertaken by the European Commission, sought to assess how far the EU has moved towards meeting its economic targets. In 2000, EU leaders at a summit in Lisbon pledged the European economy would outstrip that of the US by 2010. Their economic targets became known as the Lisbon Agenda. But the Commission report says that, in most EU countries, the pace of economic reform has been too slow, and fulfilling the Lisbon ambitions will be difficult - if not impossible.\\n \\n Only the UK, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands have actually followed up policy recommendations. Among the biggest laggards, according to the report, are Greece and Italy. The Lisbon Agenda set out to increase the number of people employed in Europe by encouraging more older people and women to stay in the workforce. It also set out to raise the amount the private sector spends on research and development, while bringing about greater discipline over public spending and debt levels. Combined with high environmental standards and efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the EU, the plan was for Europe to become the world's most dynamic economy by 2010. Next week, the Commission will present revised proposals to meet the Lisbon goals. Many people expect the 2010 target to be quietly dropped.\\n\",\n",
       " 'China continues breakneck growth\\n \\n China\\'s economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003\\'s 9.1%.\\n \\n The news may mean more limits on investment and lending as Beijing tries to take the economy off the boil. China has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats. But officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus. Growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year.\\n \\n Still, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. The result could be higher interest rates. China raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in October 2004.\\n \\n Despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. \"There is no sign of a slowdown in 2005,\" said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings.\\n \\n China\\'s economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas. Figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004, up 35%. Part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan, China\\'s currency. The government keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the US dollar, - much to the chagrin of many US lawmakers who blame China for lost jobs and competitiveness. Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate. \"We need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time,\" National Bureau of Statistics chief Li Deshui told Reuters. \"Those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Japan\\'s ageing workforce: built to last\\n \\n In his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years, then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties. And the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life.\\n \\n Mr Toshitsune is one of Japan\\'s 23,000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114. At his neat Osaka detached house, where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters, Mr Toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out Buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Between tasks, this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is: \"Well, what\\'s most important for me is to be Japan\\'s number one.\" Mr Toshitsune wants to outlive everyone. And when it comes to longevity, Japan, as a country, appears to be doing just that. Women can expect to live until 85, men until 78, four years longer than Americans and Europeans.\\n \\n On the outskirts of Kyoto, 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends, who are in their seventies.\\n \\n \"I think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved,\" he remarks. \"On average, we can live longer.\" Whether it\\'s the diet, or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined, or just something in the genes, Japan\\'s elderly are remarkable. But while life may be a game of golf for Mr Shimizu, his grandchildren have huge problems ahead. Japan is the world\\'s least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the US.\\n \\n By 2007, Japan\\'s population is expected to peak at 127 million, then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century. This means 30 million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled.\\n \\n \"In the year 2050, if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will make up over 30% of the population,\" explains Shigeo Morioka of the International Longevity Centre in Tokyo. So how will Japan\\'s finances stay on track? After a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending, the public sector debt is already about 140% of the country\\'s gross domestic product (GDP), the highest rate among industrialised countries. The International Monetary Fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running Japan\\'s welfare state will double to more than 5% of GDP, while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%. But unfortunately, Japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically. Glen Wood, Vice President of Deutsche Securities Japan, asks; \"Who\\'s going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new Japanese worker? \"Who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the leaders? Who are going to be the producers of the GDP going forward?\" One option is further welfare reform. Another is immigration, possibly from the Philippines and Indonesia. But so far, any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff.\\n \\n Standing next to Tokyo harbour is a version of New York\\'s Statue of Liberty. But, as yet, Japan is not ready for an Ellis Island.\\n \\n \"Japan has never really liked that option in its history and I think it\\'s an option that\\'s becoming more and more plausible and necessary,\" insists Mr Wood. In Japan, as in Europe which also faces a workforce decline, immigration is a very sensitive subject. But for the Japanese economy, facing 8% fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars, hi-tech kit and home appliances, perhaps even another property crash.\\n \\n Of course the Japanese could always have more children. The government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in Australia. But there would be no pay back until 2030, when today\\'s babies are taxpayers, and the demographic crisis, like in Europe, starts to unfold in 2010. In contrast to Japan - and of course the European Union - the US population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century. Although President Bush must re-devise Social Security to take account of a 130% rise in America\\'s over 65s, the IMF foresees a positive contribution to the US current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration.\\n \\n Some voices in Japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the Japanese labour market. They want a shift towards financial services, though doubts persist over the country\\'s ability, let alone willingness, to move away from manufacturing. \"Japan still has problems getting a viable banking system, let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas,\" says Mr Wood. Japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession. Falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency. Come 2020, Japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power. There are fears that the world\\'s number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession. But none of this is Mr Toshitsune\\'s concern anymore. At 101, he chuckles that, he feels fine.\\n',\n",

GE is the US\\' biggest firm based on stock market valuation. GE\\'s net profits were $5.37bn (Â£2.86bn) for the final three months of 2004, while sales came in at $43.7bn.

GE said orders in the fourth quarter were 15% higher than in the same period of 2003, \"with growth across the board\". \"In the fourth quarter, nine of our 11 businesses delivered at least double-digit earnings growth,\" said Mr Immelt. Full year 2004 gains were less spectacular, but still respectable. Net profit was up 6% at $16.6bn. Last year, GE bought Vivendi Universal, merging it with NBC to form NBC Universal.

       " 'UK economy facing \\'major risks\\'\\n \\n The UK manufacturing sector will continue to face \"serious challenges\" over the next two years, the British Chamber of Commerce (BCC) has said.\\n \\n The group\\'s quarterly survey of companies found exports had picked up in the last three months of 2004 to their best levels in eight years. The rise came despite exchange rates being cited as a major concern. However, the BCC found the whole UK economy still faced \"major risks\" and warned that growth is set to slow. It recently forecast economic growth will slow from more than 3% in 2004 to a little below 2.5% in both 2005 and 2006.\\n \\n Manufacturers\\' domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter, the survey of 5,196 firms found. Employment in manufacturing also fell and job expectations were at their lowest level for a year.\\n \\n \"Despite some positive news for the export sector, there are worrying signs for manufacturing,\" the BCC said. \"These results reinforce our concern over the sector\\'s persistent inability to sustain recovery.\" The outlook for the service sector was \"uncertain\" despite an increase in exports and orders over the quarter, the BCC noted.\\n \\n The BCC found confidence increased in the quarter across both the manufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the levels at the start of 2004. The reduced threat of interest rate increases had contributed to improved confidence, it said. The Bank of England raised interest rates five times between November 2003 and August last year. But rates have been kept on hold since then amid signs of falling consumer confidence and a slowdown in output. \"The pressure on costs and margins, the relentless increase in regulations, and the threat of higher taxes remain serious problems,\" BCC director general David Frost said. \"While consumer spending is set to decelerate significantly over the next 12-18 months, it is unlikely that investment and exports will rise sufficiently strongly to pick up the slack.\"\\n',\n",

Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.\\n \\n Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers\\' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain\\'s retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.\\n \\n \"Today\\'s no change decision is correct,\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"\\n \\n Mr Frost added: \"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"\\n \\n On Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists\\' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers\\' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers\\' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\\n \\n \"So far the evidence suggests that last year\\'s rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.\\n',\n",

The court in Washington found the case - filed by the Clinton administration in 1999 - could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws. Anti-smoking groups urge the government to fight on, but the Justice Department has not said if it will appeal. Among the accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. They were delighted by the decision, which sent Reynolds shares up 4.5% and Altria shares up 5.11%.\\n \\n Charles A Blixt, executive vice-president of RJ Reynolds Tobacco, said the ruling \"dramatically transforms\" the government\\'s lawsuit. Altria Group said, in a statement, the government now \"must not only prove that the companies have engaged in fraudulent behaviour in the past, but that they are likely to do so in the future.\"\\n \\n The government had claimed tobacco firms\\n \\n \\n  - manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction \\n  - targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns \\n  - lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary. \\n  \\n \\n Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to \"disgorge\" $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products. They brought the case under racketeering laws, which were passed to deny mafia gangs the profits of their crimes. But the tobacco companies denied that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public. They also said they had already met many of the government\\'s demands in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998. The three-judge panel in the District of Columbia\\'s Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that the US government could not sue the firms under the anti-racketeering laws. Judge David Sentelle, in his ruling, said such laws were aimed at putting an end to illegal conduct going forward. \"We hold that the language of (the law) and the comprehensive remedial scheme of (the law) preclude disgorgement as a possible remedy in this case,\" he wrote. The Justice Department refused to say if it would appeal. \"All we\\'re saying today is that we have received the ruling and are reviewing it,\" a spokeswoman said on Friday.

That took 2004\\'s total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year\\'s main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\\n \\n \"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\\n \\n \"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it\\'s showing job growth, it\\'s a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\\n \\n Job creation was one of last year\\'s main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.\\n',\n",
       " 'Glazer makes new Man Utd approach\\n \\n Malcolm Glazer has made a fresh approach to buy Manchester United, which could lead to a bid valuing the Premiership club at Â£800m.\\n \\n The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with \"detailed proposals\", it has confirmed. Mr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. His new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt. Mr Glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the Red Devils and responded by using his 28.1% shareholding to vote off three board members last November.\\n \\n Man United had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing. But newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debt-laden bid. Last week, however, Mr Glazer issued a statement to the Stock Exchange distancing himself from a new bid.\\n \\n Meanwhile, United\\'s chief executive David Gill said in December that talks would not resume unless Glazer came up with \"definitive proposals\". Now the board has confirmed that the US bidder is back, with a statement issued on Sunday reading: \"The board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer. \"A further announcement will be made in due course.\"\\n \\n To succeed Malcolm Glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus, who own 28.9% of the club. But the Irish duo have cut off talks with Glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach. United fans have reacted with anger at the announcement. They have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by Glazer since he first showed interest in the club in September 2003 and after Sunday\\'s announcement they vowed to fight on. \"We will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says. We do not want him or anybody else taking over United,\" said Mark Longden of the Independent Manchester United Supporters\\' Association. \"The campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since Glazer first showed interest in the club.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Wall Street cheers Bush victory\\n \\n The US stock market has closed higher in response to George W Bush\\'s victory in the presidential elections.\\n \\n The benchmark Dow Jones share index closed more than 1% higher at 10,137, while the Nasdaq rose 0.9% to 2,004. Many investors believe that Mr Bush\\'s policies are more business-friendly than those of his Democrat challenger, John Kerry. The higher share prices also reflect relief that a clear winner has emerged from what proved to be a tight poll.\\n \\n Investors had worried that the outcome of the poll would be inconclusive, paving the way for a repeat of the legal wrangling that marred the 2000 election.\\n \\n The Dow lost 5% of its value in the three weeks immediately after that election, when it was unclear who would occupy the White House. Mr Kerry conceded defeat on Wednesday, abandoning last-ditch hopes of carrying the vote in the swing state of Ohio. \"The relief for the markets may be that we have a decision and can move forward,\" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management. Some analysts predicted that the jump in share prices would be short-lived, saying investors would quickly focus once again on the health of the US economy. \"I would look at the stock market rally for Bush as kind of a one-day event,\" said Ken Mayland at Clearview Economics. The US\\' recent economic performance has been mixed, with solid growth offset by disappointingly low job creation figures, and mounting worries over a record budget deficit. Elsewhere in the financial markets on Wednesday, the dollar dipped slightly against the euro and climbed against the yen, while US oil prices closed up $1.26 at $50.88 a barrel in New York. The rise in oil prices partly reflects the view that President Bush is less likely than Mr Kerry to release supplies from the US\\' strategic oil reserve. Share prices in London, Frankfurt and Paris also closed higher.\\n \\n Successive polls in the run-up to Tuesday\\'s election had shown the two candidates running neck and neck.\\n \\n Economic issues, as well as the war in Iraq, were the forefront of the campaign. In key swing states such as Ohio, which has suffered substantial job losses in the past four years, President Bush\\'s handling of the economy became a crucial election issue. Senator Kerry attacked President Bush\\'s economic record during his campaign, hammering home the fact that a net 800,000 jobs were lost during his term in office. President Bush focused on the fact that two million jobs have been created in the past year, claiming that it has vindicated his tax-cutting agenda. As for future policies, both candidates pledged to bring America\\'s $422bn federal budget deficit under control. Senator Kerry planned to increase taxes on those earning more than $200,000 a year. President Bush has placed reform of the pensions system at the heart of his economic agenda for a second term. However, economists have said both candidates\\' economic programmes rested on questionable assumptions about future growth.\\n',\n",
       " 'Business confidence dips in Japan\\n \\n Business confidence among Japanese manufacturers has weakened for the first time since March 2003, the quarterly Tankan survey has found.\\n \\n Slower economic growth, rising oil prices, a stronger yen and weaker exports were blamed for the fall. December\\'s confidence level was below that seen in September, the Bank of Japan said. However, September\\'s reading was the strongest for 13 years. \"The economy is at a pause but unlikely to fall\", the economy minister said. \"It will feel a bit slower (next year) than this year, and growth may be a bit more gentle but the situation is that the recovery will continue,\" said economy minister Heizo Takenaka. In the Bank of Japan\\'s December survey, the balance of big manufacturers saying business conditions are better, minus those saying they are worse, was 22, down from 26 in September.\\n \\n Japan\\'s economy grew by just 0.1% in the three months to September, according revised data issued this month. With the recovery slowing, the world\\'s second biggest economy is now expected grow by 0.2% in 2004. The Tankan index is based on a survey of 10,227 firms. Big manufacturers were even more pessimistic about the first quarter of 2005; their views suggest the March reading could go as low as 15 - still in positive territory, but weaker. The dollar\\'s decline has strengthened the yen, making Japanese exports more expensive in the US. China\\'s attempts to cool down its fast-growing economy have also hit Japanese industry\\'s sales abroad. Confidence among non-manufacturers was unchanged in the final quarter of 2004, but it is forecast to drop one point in the March survey. Nonetheless, Japanese firms have been stepping up capital investment, and the survey found the pace is quickening. Companies reported they expect to invest 7.7% more in the year to March 2005 than the previous year - up from expectations of 6.1% increase in the September Tankan.\\n',\n",

Christian Aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in Bangladesh alone being axed. However, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for Western consumers.\\n \\n It will also see more jobs created in India and China, advocates argue. The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. \"There will be a period of adjustment required,\" said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. \"Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. \"Some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships.\"\\n \\n Christian Aid has called on British firms not to simply \"cut and run\" but look after their workers, in a new report called Rags To Riches To Rags.\\n \\n It added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. Some of the world\\'s fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country\\'s exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. The MFA pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. \"The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal,\" Andrew Pendleton, Christian Aid\\'s head of Trade Policy, said. \"They will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. \"We are deeply concerned that the New Year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers.\" The WTO said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.\\n \\n It added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should \"put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost\". While the current MFA was not perfect, its did allow Third World countries like Bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, Christian Aid said. \"International trade must not be governed by a \\'race to the bottom\\' that pitches one set of poor people against another,\" Mr Pendleton added.\\n',\n",

About 1,100 jobs will go in investment banking while 1,200 and 550 will go in IT and human resources respectively. ABN Amro is the third large European bank to announce cutbacks in the past month following Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse Group.\\n \\n Its profitability has been hit by a fall in mortgage lending in the United States - the bank\\'s largest single market - following recent interest rate rises. ABN Amro\\'s operations in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom will be hardest hit. Jobs will also be lost in the US - which accounted for 46% of profit in the first half of 2004 - and across its operations in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions.\\n \\n The restructuring is designed to improve efficiency by reducing administrative costs and increasing focus on client service. The bank said it was on course for a 10% rise in net income this year but operating profits are set to fall because of a fall in US revenues. ABN Amro currently has more than 100,000 staff. \"To get any profit growth in the coming years, they will have to lower costs, so shedding jobs makes total sense,\" Ivo Geijsen, an analyst with Bank Oyens & Van Eeghen, told Bloomberg. Europe\\'s leading banks seem set for a period of retrenchment. Deutsche Bank said earlier this month it would reduce its German workforce by 1,920 while as many as 300 jobs will be lost at Credit Suisse First Boston.\\n',\n",
       " 'Fannie Mae \\'should restate books\\'\\n \\n US mortgage company Fannie Mae should restate its earnings, a move that is likely to put a billion-dollar dent in its accounts, watchdogs have said.\\n \\n The Securities & Exchange Commission accused Fannie Mae of using techniques that \"did not comply in material respects\" with accounting standards. Fannie Mae last month warned that some records were incorrect. The other main US mortgage firm Freddie Mac restated earnings by $5bn (Â£2.6bn) last year after a probe of its books. The SEC\\'s comments are likely to increase pressure on Congress to strengthen supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\\n \\n The two firms are key parts of the US financial system and effectively underwrite the mortgage market, financing nearly half of all American house purchases and dealing actively in bonds and other financial instruments. The investigation of Freddie Mac in June 2003 sparked concerns about the wider health of the industry and raised questionsmarks over the role of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the industry\\'s main regulator. Having been pricked into action, the OFHEO turned its attention to Fannie May and in September this year said that the firm had tweaked its books to spread earnings more smoothly across quarters and play down the amount of risk it had taken on. The SEC found similar problems. The watchdog\\'s chief accountant Donald Nicolaisen said that \"Fannie Mae\\'s methodology of assessing, measuring and documenting hedge ineffectiveness was inadequate and was not supported\" by generally accepted accounting principles.\\n',\n",
       " 'US to rule on Yukos refuge call\\n \\n Yukos has said a US bankruptcy court will decide whether to block Russia\\'s impending auction of its main production arm on Thursday.\\n \\n The Russian oil firm has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US in an attempt to halt the forced sale. However, Judge Letitia Clark said the hearing would continue on Thursday when arguments in the case would be heard. Russian authorities are due to auction off Yuganskneftegas on 19 December to pay a huge tax bill sent to Yukos.\\n \\n Russian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm\\'s most lucrative asset Yuganskneftegas to help pay a $27bn (Â£14bn) back tax bill, which they claim is owed by Yukos.\\n \\n Filing for bankruptcy protection in the US was \"a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders, employees and customers,\" said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede. The company added it had opted to take action through American courts as US bankruptcy law gives worldwide jurisdiction over a debtor company\\'s property and because it was seeking a judiciary willing to protect the value of shareholders\\' investments. However, as the firm is based in Russia and has no significant US assets, lawyers are unsure of the outcome of the case. \"We are here to stop 60% of our body from being cut off on Sunday,\" Zack Clement, a lawyer for Yukos, told Judge Clark in an emergency hearing in Houston, Texas, on Wednesday. As well as the bid to get Chapter 11 bankruptcy - which protects firms from creditors, allowing them to continue trading as they restructure their finances - the group also made a claim for damages against the Russian government. Yukos asked the Houston court to order Russia to arbitration so that it can press claims for billions of dollars in damages over a \"campaign of illegal, discriminatory and disproportionate\" tax claims. Mr Clement said that under Russian law, the Russian government was obliged to enter into arbitration as set out in international law.\\n \\n He added that the opening bid for the firm\\'s Yuganskneftgas unit was $8bn - less than half of the $20bn that Yukos advisers say it is worth. \"We believe the only significant bidder at the auction on Sunday is Gazprom,\" he said, referring to Russia\\'s natural gas giant. Yukos maintains that the forced auction is illegal and \"will cause the company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm.\" Many commentators believe the Russian government\\'s aggressive pursuit of Yukos is a politically-motivated response to the political ambitions of its former chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, who had funded liberal opposition groups, was arrested in October last year on fraud and tax evasion charges and is still in jail Analysts believe that if its production unit is auctioned off, it is likely to be bought up by a government-backed firm, like Gazprom, effectively bringing a large chunk of Russia\\'s lucrative oil and gas industry back under state control.\\n',\n",
       " \"J&J agrees $25bn Guidant deal\\n \\n Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has agreed to buy medical technology firm Guidant for $25.4bn (Â£13bn).\\n \\n Guidant is a key producer of equipment that combats heart problems such as implant defibrillators and pacemakers. Analysts said that the deal is aimed at offsetting Johnson & Johnson's reliance on a slowing drug business. They also pointed out that more mergers are likely because the drug and healthcare industries are fragmented and are under pressure to cut costs. A number of Johnson & Johnson's products are facing patent expirations, while the company is also battling fierce competition from generic products. Meanwhile, demand for defibrillators, which give the heart a small electric shock when an irregular heartbeat or rhythm is detected, is expected to increase, analysts said. The move by Johnson & Johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay $76 for each Guidant share, 6% more than Wednesday's closing price. Analysts say that US antitrust regulators could force the firms to shed some overlapping stent operations. Stents are tubes that are used to keep an artery open after it has been unblocked.\\n\",\n",

The original size of Libya\\'s funds was $400m, the central bank told Reuters. However, the withdrawal did not mean that Libya had cut its ties with the US, he added.\\n \\n \"We are in the process of opening accounts in banks in the United States,\" the central bank\\'s vice president Farhat Omar Ben Gadaravice said. The previously frozen assets had been invested in various countries and are believed to have included equity holdings in banks. The US ban on trade and economic activity with Tripoli - imposed by then president Ronald Regan in 1986 after a series of what the US deemed terrorist acts, including the 1988 Lockerbie air crash - was suspended in April. Bankers from the two country\\'s had been working on how to unfreeze Libya\\'s assets.\\n',\n",

Phytopharm shares jumped 10.7% on the news, with analysts saying sales of $600m (Â£309m) a year were possible. The plant, licensed to Phytopharm in 1997, has been used for thousands of years by the Sans bushmen of the Kalahari desert to stave off hunger. Studies have reportedly shown the plant curbs appetite instead of reducing calorific intake like many existing products.\\n \\n Phytopharm will receive an initial fee of Â£6.5m from Unilever - out of a potential total of Â£21m - as well as future royalties on product sales. Under the deal, production of the Hoodia cactus at Phytopharm\\'s nursery in South Africa will also rise from eight million plants to potentially hundreds of millions, said Phytopharm chief executive Richard Dixey. The firm had initially hoped to market a slimming drug from Hoodia with Pfizer. But the research collaboration came to an end in 2003. Analysts said Unilever could launch the new products in 2007. \"This deal goes a long way to restoring the market faith in Phytopharm\\'s pipeline after the Pfizer exit,\" said analyst Erling Refsum at Nomura.\\n',\n",

However, the country\\'s vice president Jose Alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution. Varig is struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of 6.5 billion reais ($2.3bn or Â£1.2bn). Asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting of the country\\'s Congress to discuss the airline\\'s crisis, Mr Alencar replied: \"No, I don\\'t think so. We will see.\"\\n \\n Earlier, Mr Wilson had said that president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week. \"In practice, it will be an intervention, although this is not the technical name used\", he said. An intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances. For that to happen Varig\\'s main shareholder, the non-profit Ruben Berta Foundation which represents the airline\\'s employees, would have to be removed, Mr Wilson said. However, no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying, he added. Varig, which operates in 18 countries apart from Brazil, has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country\\'s economic downturn.\\n \\n The depreciation of Brazil\\'s currency has had a direct impact on the airline\\'s dollar debt as well as some of its costs. Business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the Brazilian economy. The airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government. On Tuesday the courts awarded Varig 2bn reais ($725m), after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992. But the government can appeal the decision.\\n',\n",

Laurent Beaudoin, part of the family that controls the Montreal-based firm, will take on the role of CEO under a newly created management structure. Analysts said the resignations seem to have stemmed from a boardroom dispute. Under Mr Tellier\\'s tenure at the company, which began in January 2003, plans to cut the worldwide workforce of 75,000 by almost a third by 2006 were announced. The firm\\'s snowmobile division and defence services unit were also sold and Bombardier started the development of a new aircraft seating 110 to 135 passengers.\\n \\n Mr Tellier had indicated he wanted to stay at the world\\'s top train maker and third largest manufacturer of civil aircraft until the restructuring was complete. But Bombardier has been faced with a declining share price and profits. Earlier this month the firm said it earned $10m (Â£19.2m) in the third quarter, down from a profit of $133m a year ago. \"I understand the board\\'s concern that I would not be there for the long-term and the need to develop and execute strategies, and the need to reshape the management structure at this time,\" Mr Tellier said in a statement on Monday.

       " \"Brazil approves bankruptcy reform\\n \\n A major reform of Brazil's bankruptcy laws has been approved by the country's Congress, in a move which it is hoped will cut the cost of borrowing.\\n \\n The bill, proposed in 1993, has finally been approved by the leadership of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The old law, dating from 1945, gave priority first to workers, second to tax revenue and finally to creditors. The new legislation changes this, giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers. The new regulations will limit payments to workers to 150 times the minimum monthly salary, which is currently $94. The law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy. However, when a firm is declared bankrupt it will gain protection from creditors for 180 days while a recovery plan is worked out.\\n \\n The proposals were opposed in the past by leftist parties, including Mr Lula's Worker Party. They considered that they undermined workers' rights. But President Lula became a defender of the reforms, arguing that the country's bank lending margins were among the highest in the world and were damaging the economy. According to Andreas Adriano of Latin Trade Magazine, the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds. Nevertheless, Mr Adriano said to reduce the basic interest rate the Central Bank needs to change its policy, focusing not only on inflation but also on economic growth.\\n\",\n",

But the figures, along with this week\\'s inflation report, could trigger another interest rate rise in the New Year. However, recent data from the British Retail Consortium showed a 0.2% slip in High Street sales during November.\\n \\n The ONS data confounded analyst expectations. Many had expected sales to fall slightly in November as shoppers put off buying Christmas presents until December. However, retailers\\' attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind November\\'s unexpected rise in sales, they say. Aggressive tactics, such as one-day discount sales adopted by stores such as Marks & Spencer, appear to have paid off. \"Price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales hasn\\'t grown as much as volumes,\" said Investec economist David Page. The figures sparked a rally for sterling as the data supported the view that it is too early to assume that base rates have peaked.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cairn shares slump on oil setback\\n \\n Shares in Cairn Energy, a UK oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.\\n \\n The company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable. Cairn\\'s shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year. Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he was \"disappointed\" with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan. Investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a \"significant downgrade of the initial expectation\".\\n \\n Cairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. The company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; Â£10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. A spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field\\'s current value.\\n \\n \"Cairn refutes the government\\'s position,\" Mr Gammell said. He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - India\\'s state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - and not the contractor. \"We have a pretty strong legal case here,\" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statements though. The shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. \"I think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,\" said analyst Jason Kenney at ING.\\n \\n The disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for Cairn\\'s existing oilfields. The company raised targets for its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in India from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. \"These two fields will provide the core of the future developments in Rajasthan,\" Mr Gammell said. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to South Asia from interests in the US and Europe. Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.\\n',\n",

Airbus head Noel Forgeard is now set to replace Mr Camus, bringing the company\\'s power struggle to an end. Fighting between Mr Camus and Mr Forgeard has hit the headlines in France and analysts feared that this fighting could destabilise the defence and aerospace group.

The other main shareholders of EADS are the French government (15%) , who also support Mr Forgeard, and Germany\\'s DaimlerChrysler (30%). Rainer Hertrich, the German co-head of EADS will also step down when his contract expires next year.\\n \\n Mr Camus recently came under pressure as it became clear that the A380 superjumbo was running over budget. EADS - Airbus\\' majority owner - admitted earlier this week that the project was running 1.45bn euros (Â£1bn; $1.9bn) over budget. But Mr Forgeard has denied this, telling French media that there is no current overrun in the budget. \"But for the sake of transparency, we told our shareholders last week that if we look at the forecast for total costs of the project up to 2010, there is a risk that we will go over by around 10%, which is about 1bn euros (Â£686m; $1.32bn),\" he told France\\'s LCI Television.

Meanwhile, another of its major money spinners - cholesterol drug Crestor - is facing mounting safety concerns. \"This would be two of the three blockbuster drugs that were meant to power the company forward failing... and we\\'ve got risks on Crestor,\" said Nick Turner, analyst at brokers Jefferies.\\n \\n AstraZeneca had hoped to pitch its Iressa drug against rival medicine Tarceva. But Iressa proved no better than a placebo in extending lives in the trial involving 1,692 patients. Tarceva - made by OSI Pharmaceuticals, Genentech and Roche - has already proved to be successful in helping prolong the life of lung cancer patients. AztraZeneca has now appointed a new executive director to the board. John Patterson will be in charge of drug development. The company said Mr Patterson would make \"substantial changes to the clinical organisation and its processes\". \"I am determined to improve our development and regulatory performance, restore confidence in the company and value to shareholders,\" said chief executive Tom McKillop.\\n',\n",

Tightly packed populations in the areas involved in natural and man-made disasters were to partly to blame for the rise in claims, it said. Some 95% of insurance claims were for natural catastrophes, with the rest attributed to made-made events.\\n \\n The largest claims came from the US, which was struck by four hurricanes, and Japan, which suffered the highest concentration of typhoons for decades plus a major earthquake.\\n \\n Europe suffered fewer natural disasters, but 191 people were killed and more than 2,000 injured in March after the terrorist attack on train stations in Madrid. The damages claimed in 2004 eclipsed previous years, including 2001 when the 11 September attacks pushed claims up to $37bn. Swiss Re said it had registered about 300 natural and man-made disasters around the world in 2004.

He claims the banks were aware of the problems but continued to work with the company so they could earn commissions. Parmalat has not identified which banks it has gone after this time. Under Italian law, administrators can seek to get back money paid to financial institutions prior to insolvency, if there is a suspicion that the institutions knew that the company was in financial trouble. The firm also said it is preparing further law suits.\\n \\n According to the Reuters news agency, 35 of the companies sued on Thursday are Italian while the remaining 10 are international. The unidentified Parmalat source also told Reuters that the company was planning to take action against a total of 80 financial institutions. Among those already targeted are Bank of America, UBS, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup. It has also gone after auditors Grant Thornton. They have all denied any wrongdoing. Parmalat was declared insolvent in December 2003 after it emerged that 4bn euros thought to be held in an offshore account did not in fact exist. In the investigation that followed it became apparent that the company, among other things, had been billing clients twice in order to boost sales and bolster the balance sheet. That enabled Parmalat to borrow heavily and expand overseas, allowing it to become a darling of the Italian stock exchange.\\n',\n",

These two projects aim to develop Khurmala field to produce 100,000 barrels per day and raise the output of Himrin. The winners of the contract are to build new flow lines and build gas separation stations. The contract to develop the Suba-Luhais field has not yet been awarded as Iraq's Oil Ministry is studying the offers. If Iraq's cabinet approves the oil ministry's choice of companies, then this will be the first deal that Iraq has signed with a foreign oil company.

       " 'Yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction\\n \\n A little-known Russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant Yukos at auction in Moscow.\\n \\n Baikal Finance Group outbid favourite Gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly, to buy Yuganskneftegas. Baikal paid 260.75bn roubles ($9.37bn: Â£4.8bn) for Yugansk - nowhere near the $27bn Russia says Yukos owes in taxes. Yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and Russian law, and said Baikal had bought itself trouble.\\n \\n \"The company considers that the victor of today\\'s auction has bought itself a serious $9bn headache,\" said Yukos spokesman Alexander Shadrin. He said the company would continue to make \"every lawful move\" to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in Yukos from \"this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property\". Meanwhile, Tim Osborne, head of Yukos main shareholders\\' group Menatep, said that Yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside Russia, against the auction winners. Reports from Russia say Baikal has paid a deposit of nearly $1.7bn from a Sberbank (Savings Bank) account to the Russian Federal Property Fund, for Yugansk.\\n \\n The sale came despite a restraining order issued by a US court dealing with the firm\\'s bankruptcy application for Chapter 11 protection. Yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but Russian authorities argued they were imposing the law, trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes. There were originally four registered bidders, and with its close ties to the Kremlin, state-backed gas monopoly Gazprom had been seen as favourite. But just two companies turned up for the auction, Gazprom and the unknown Baikal Finance Group, named after a large freshwater lake in Siberia. And, according to Tass news agency, Gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for Baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles.\\n \\n Mystery firm Baikal Finance Group is officially registered in the central Russian region of Tver, but many analysts believe it may be linked to Gazprom. Kaha Kiknavelidze, analyst at Troika Dialog, said: \"I think a decision that Yugansk should end up with Gazprom was taken a long time ago. So the main question was how to structure this transaction.\\n \\n \"I would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and Gazprom now has a partner. \"I would also not exclude that Baikal will decline to pay in 14 days, that are given by law, and Gazprom is then recognised as the winner. This would give Gazprom an extra 14 days to accumulate the needed funds. \"Another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price.\" However, Gazprom has announced it is not linked to Baikal in any way. And Paul Collison, chief analyst at Brunswick UBS, said: \"I see no plausible explanation for the theory that Baikal was representing competing interests. \"Yugansk will most likely end up with Gazprom but could still end up with the government. There is still potential for surprises.\" Yugansk is at the heart of Yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day. The unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than $27bn in taxes and fines. Yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant, and had sought refuge in US courts.\\n \\n The US bankruptcy court\\'s initial order on Thursday - to temporarily block the sale - in response to Yukos filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, was upheld in a second ruling on Saturday. The protection, if recognised by the Russian authorities, would have allowed Yukos\\' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets. Yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is now in jail, on separate fraud charges. But President Vladimir Putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption - and the BBC\\'s Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says most Russians believe the destruction of Yukos is now inevitable. Hours before the auction lawyers for Menatep, a group through which Mr Khodorkovsky and his associates control Yukos, said they would take legal action in other countries. Menatep lawyers, who were excluded from observing the auction, said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound Russian oil and gas exports.\\n',\n",

The LSE, which saw its shares rise 25%, said the bid undervalued the business. Euronext - formed after the Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam exchanges merged - is reportedly working with three investment banks on a possible offer. The LSE, Europe\\'s biggest stock market, is a key prize, listing stocks with a total capitalisation of Â£1.4 trillion.\\n \\n Euronext already has a presence in London due to its 2001 acquisition of London-based options and futures exchange Liffe.

It is also working with Morgan Stanley. Despite the rejection of the Deutsche Boerse bid last week, Werner Seifert, chief executive of the Frankfurt-based exchange, may well come back with an improved offer. It has long wanted to link up with London, and the two tried and failed to seal a merger in 2000. Responding to the LSE\\'s rebuff, Deutsche Boerse - whose market capitalisation is more than Â£3bn - said it believed it could show its proposal offered benefits, and that it still hoped to make a cash bid.\\n \\n Last week the LSE said not only was the bid undervalued, but that it had \"been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented\". However, it has indicated it is open for further talks. Meanwhile, German magazine Der Spiegel said part of Mr Seifert\\'s negotiations with the LSE were about where to base the future board of any merged exchange. While Mr Seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of London, the mayor of Frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost German jobs. Many analysts believe German Boerse has more financial firepower than Euronext if it came to a bidding war.\\n',\n",

And the Regent Street Association said shops in central London were also expecting the \"best Christmas ever\". That picture comes despite reports of disappointing festive sales in the last couple of weeks.\\n \\n The Trafford Centre spokeswoman said about 8,500 thousand vehicles had arrived at the centre on Saturday before 1130 GMT. \"We predict that the next week will continue the same trend,\" she added.\\n \\n It was a similar story at Bluewater in Kent. Spokesman Alan Jones said he expected 150,000 shoppers to have visited by the end of Saturday and a further 100,000 on Sunday. \"Our sales so far have been 2% up on the same time last year,\" he said. \"We\\'re very busy, it\\'s really strong and people will be shopping right up until Christmas. \"Over the Christmas period we\\'re expecting people to spend in excess of Â£200m at the centre.\"\\n \\n On Saturday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the St David\\'s Shopping Centre in Cardiff said it looked like being its busiest day of the year with about 200,000 shoppers expected to have visited by the close of play.

Russia\\'s newspapers claimed that Baikal was a front for gas monopoly Gazprom, which had been expected to win. The sale has destroyed Yukos, once the owner of Yuganskneftegas, said founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. \"Yuganskneftegas has been sold in the best traditions of the 90s. The authorities have made themselves a wonderful Christmas present - Russia\\'s most efficient oil company has been destroyed,\" the Interfax news agency quoted Mr Khodorkovsky as saying via his lawyers.\\n \\n Gazprom had been expected to win the auction but is thought to have failed to get finance for the deal after a US court injunction barred it from taking part. Last week, Yukos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US in a last-ditch attempt to hang on to Yuganskneftegas, which accounts for 60% of its output. A US judge banned Gazprom from taking part in the auction and barred international banks from providing the firm with cash. \"They screwed up the financing,\" said Ronald Smith, an analyst at Renaissance Capital in Moscow. \"And Gazprom doesn\\'t have this sort of money lying around.\"\\n \\n Gazprom has denied that it is behind the purchase. \"It is a front for somebody but not necessarily for Gazprom,\" said Oleg Maximov, an analyst at Troika Dialog in Moscow. \"We don\\'t know if this company is linked 100% to Gazprom.\\n \\n \"We tried to find it, but we couldn\\'t and as far as I know, the papers had the same result.\" The sale has however bought time for Gazprom to raise the money needed for the purchase, analysts said. One scenario is that Baikal will not pay when it is supposed to in two weeks time, putting Yuganskneftegas back in the hands of bailiffs and back within the reach of Gazprom. Yukos is not planning on letting go of its unit without a fight and has threatened legal action against any buyer. Menatep, Yukos main shareholders\\' group, has also threatened legal action. Yukos claims that it is being punished for the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now in jail facing separate fraud charges.

Talks with the European stock market and with rival bidder Deutsche Boerse will continue, the LSE said.

LSE saw its shares surge 4.9% to a new high of 583p in early trade, following the announcement on Monday.\\n \\n The offer follows widespread media speculation that Euronext would make an offer for LSE. Experts now widely expect a bidding war for Europe\\'s biggest stock market, which lists stocks with a total capitalisation of Â£1.4 trillion, to break out. Commentators say that a deal with Euronext, which owns the Liffe derivatives exchange in London and combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, could potentially offer the LSE more cost savings than a deal with Deutsche Boerse.\\n \\n A weekend report in the Telegraph had quoted an unnamed executive at Euronext as saying the group would make a cash bid to trump Deutsche Boerse\\'s offer. \"Because we already own Liffe in London, the cost savings available to us from a merger are far greater than for Deutsche Boerse,\" the newspaper quoted the executive as saying. Euronext chief executive Jean-Francois Theodore is reported to have already held private talks with LSE\\'s chief executive Clara Furse. Further reports had suggested that Euronext could make an offer in excess of the LSE\\'s 533p a share closing price on Friday.

CML figures showed gross lending fell by 4% in November as the number of people buying new homes fell. Elsewhere, the BBA added underlying mortgage lending rose by Â£4m in November, compared to October\\'s Â£4.29m. The CML said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year-on-year to 85,000 - the lowest total seen since February 2003.\\n \\n Data from the CML showed lending fell to just over Â£25bn in November, from Â£25.5bn a year earlier. Separate figures from the Building Societies Association showed the value of mortgage approvals -- loans agreed but not yet made -- stood 32% lower than at the same time last year, at a seasonally-adjusted Â£2.98bn. The figures come hot on the heels of new data from property website Rightmove which suggested owners must indulge in a \"winter sale\" and slash prices by up to 8%. Miles Shipside, commercial director at Rightmove, said sellers would have to be \"more realistic with their asking prices\" to tempt buyers. The average asking price of a home fell by more than Â£600 from Â£190,329 in November to Â£189,733 in December, while the length of time it takes to sell a home rose to 81 days from 53 in the summer.\\n \\n Rightmove said estate agents were set to enter 2005 with a third more properties on their books than a year ago. \"Even once the quieter holiday period is over, sellers will find themselves competing with a lot of other properties on the market. In any business, excess supply and low demand means one thing - cut prices,\" Mr Shipside said.\\n \\n \"The proof is that some properties that have been appropriately discounted are selling, even in the current market.\" Overall, asking prices have fallen 3.3% from their July peaks as the equivalent of Â£6,500 has been cut from an average property. A host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in 2005. \"What is apparent is a picture of a slowing market, but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole,\" CML director general Michael Coogan said. \"It\\'s a fairly consistent picture, showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again, which is consistent with a continuing correction in the housing market,\" Investec economist Philip Shaw said. \"However, the figures do suggest only a modest weakening, and we stand by our view that the property market will remain in the doldrums for some time, though a collapse is still unlikely.\"\\n',\n",

Yukos\\' US lawyers will attempt to have Baikal assets frozen after the Russian government ignored a US court order last week blocking the sale.

Many observers believe that the unit, which produces 60% of Yukos\\' oil output, could ultimately fall into the hands of Surgutneftegas or even Gazprom, the state gas firm which opted out of the auction.\\n \\n The Russian government forced the sale of Yukos\\' most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a $27bn back tax bill it says the company owes. Yukos\\' US lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of US bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction. On Wednesday, Yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group. \"We believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us,\" Yukos spokesman Mike Lake told Agence France Press. \"If it exports that oil, it will be marketing a stolen product,\" he added.

It is America\\'s second largest financial institution.\\n \\n Recent investigations have exposed extensive accounting errors at Fannie Mae, which supplies funds to America\\'s $8 trillion mortgage market. Last week, the firm was admonished by the Securities and Exchange Commission which said it had made major errors in its financial reporting.\\n \\n The financial regulator said Fannie Mae would have to raise substantial new capital to restore its balance sheet. Analysts said the SEC\\'s criticism made it impossible for Fannie Mae\\'s senior executives to remain. Mr Raines, head of the Office of Management and Budget under President Clinton, has taken early retirement while Mr Howard has also stepped down, the company said on Tuesday. KPMG, Fannie Mae\\'s independent auditor, will also be replaced. \"By my early retirement, I have held myself accountable,\" Mr Raines said in a statement.\\n \\n Fannie Mae was found to have violated accounting rules relating to derivatives - financial instruments used to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates - and some pre-paid loans. As a result, it could be forced to restate $9bn in earnings over the past four years, effectively wiping out a third of the company\\'s profits since 2001. Although not making loans directly to buyers, Fannie Mae is the largest single player in the mortgage market, underwriting half of all US house purchases. The firm operates under charter from the US Congress. It has faced stinging criticism from Congressional leaders who held hearings into its finances earlier this year and from government regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). \"We are encouraged that the board\\'s announcement signals a new culture and a new direction for Fannie Mae,\" Armando Falcon, OFHEO director said. The problems afflicting Fannie Mae are just the latest to hit the US mortgage industry. Freddie Mac, the country\\'s other largest mortgage firm, was forced to restate its earnings by $4.4bn last year and pay a $125m fine after an investigation of its books.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cannabis hopes for drug firm\\n \\n A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.\\n \\n The drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug\\'s benefits. But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.\\n \\n Approximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK. Many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.\\n \\n Now, GW Pharma\\'s Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. \"We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,\" said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.\\n \\n The UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex\\'s launch in the UK. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p.\\n',\n",
       " 'Bush to get \\'tough\\' on deficit\\n \\n US president George W Bush has pledged to introduce a \"tough\" federal budget next February in a bid to halve the country\\'s deficit in five years.\\n \\n The US budget and its trade deficit are both deep in the red, helping to push the dollar to lows against the euro and fuelling fears about the economy. Mr Bush indicated there would be \"strict discipline\" on non-defence spending in the budget. The vow to cut the deficit had been one of his re-election declarations. The federal budget deficit hit a record $412bn (Â£211.6bn) in the 12 months to 30 September and $377bn in the previous year.\\n \\n \"We will submit a budget that fits the times,\" Mr Bush said. \"It will provide every tool and resource to the military, will protect the homeland, and meet other priorities of the government.\" The US has said it is committed to a strong dollar. But the dollar\\'s weakness has hit European and Asian exporters and lead to calls for US intervention to boost the currency. Mr Bush, however, has said the best way to halt the dollar\\'s slide is to deal with the US deficit. \"It\\'s a budget that I think will send the right signal to the financial markets and to those concerned about our short-term deficits,\" Mr Bush added. \"As well, we\\'ve got to deal with the long-term deficit issues.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'House prices drop as sales slow\\n \\n House prices fell further in November and property sale times lengthened as rate rises took their toll, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors found.\\n \\n A total of 48% of chartered surveyor estate agents reported lower prices in the three months to November - the highest level in 12 years. Meanwhile the number of sales dropped 32% to an average of 22 per surveyor. The amount of unsold properties on their books rose for the sixth month in a row to an average of 67 properties. \"The slowdown occurring in the market has given buyers more power to negotiate, but this time of year is traditionally a quiet one,\" RICS housing spokesman Ian Perry said. \"The decision by the Bank of England not to increase interest rates further and the healthy economy is allowing confidence to consolidate.\"\\n \\n The figures support recent data from the government and other bodies which all point to a slowdown in the housing market. On Monday, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, British Bankers Association and Building Societies Association all said mortgage lending was slowing. The figures were published as another survey by property website Rightmove said the average asking price of a home fell by more than Â£600 from Â£190,329 in November to Â£189,733 in December. Around the UK, the Midlands and South saw the biggest price falls, while London prices fell but at less than the national rate. In Scotland, where prices have remained on an upward path, increases were more \"moderate\", RICS added. But the news failed to dent confidence that sales will recover in future, with surveyors at their most optimistic in a year - as new purchase inquiries stabilised despite holding at lower levels. \"Sales usually pick up in the New Year and I am confident this year will be no exception,\" Mr Perry added. Looking ahead, the group is anticipating a quiet start to 2005 with the market picking up in the second half - prompting a 3% rise in prices over the coming 12 months.\\n',\n",
       " 'Fresh hope after Argentine crisis\\n \\n Three years after Argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis, there is fresh hope.\\n \\n The country\\'s economy is set to grow about 8% this year after seeing 9% growth last year, a sharp turnaround from 2002 when output fell 11%. The unemployment rate is improving, too: It is set to slip below 13% by the end of the year, down from 20% in May 2002. True, problems remain, but the overall picture is one of vast improvement. Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) admits this. \"The Argentine authorities are proud, should be proud, of the strong performance of the economy,\" Thomas Dawson, an IMF director, said earlier this month.\\n \\n Argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in 2001 culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors. The debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which, at least initially, was made worse by the government\\'s decisions. Pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the country\\'s massive debts. In response, angry crowds of ordinary Argentines took to the streets where dozens of lives were lost in clashes with the police. Two presidents and at least three finance minister resigned in less than a month. Argentina was on the brink of collapse. The fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the peso\\'s decade-long peg to the US dollar in February 2002. The subsequent devaluation saw thousands of people\\'s life savings disappear. Scathes of companies went bust. \"Three years ago, every sector [of the economy] was hit by the crisis,\" said entrepreneur Drayton Valentine. It really was dire.\\n \\n But since then, the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically, in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within Brazil. \"Agriculture and tourism are helping,\" said entrepreneur Drayton Valentine.\\n \\n Mr Valentine, who was born in the United States but grew up in Argentina, was fortunate: At the time of the crisis, his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad. But now he is using his money to help with the start-up a trading company. He explained that initially, his firm is going to export building materials to Spain and United States. Then, he would like to diversify to other areas, depending on the market. \"Locally there is a sense of recovery, many companies are exporting now,\" he said, noting that a lot of firms, which were closed during the crisis, are re-opening.\\n \\n But not all that shines is gold. Argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of 2001. President Nestor Kirchner\\'s administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors, but with the debts\\' nominal value standing at around $100bn it is not proving easy. Debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate. Argentina\\'s current offer implies that the creditors would get just 25 cents for each dollar they are owed, according to the creditors. Understandably, they want more and until they do, both they and others are loath to continue lending. For President Kirchner, this proves a hopeless challenge. Real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay, observed Jack Boorman, adviser to IMF\\'s managing director, Rodrigo Rato. \"Everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the Argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached,\" he said. \"The cost is enormous, and continues to be paid, and will not be reversed by any restructuring.\"\\n \\n With the international negotiations being troubled, it is of little help to President Kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well.\\n \\n This is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits. \"The situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in Argentina, \" said Carlos Baez Silva, president of AARA, an association that represents bank account and bond holders. Few people have recovered more than about half their savings, Mr Baez Silva estimated, pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government, people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe. \"A lot of them invested in good faith,\" he said. \"The Argentine state responded by taking most of their investments.\" The affair has made Mr Baez Silva disillusioned with the country\\'s legal system. On occasion, the Supreme Court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents, he says, insisting that the system cannot be trusted. \"People have to deposit their money in the banks, not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses.\" Mr Valentine, who was born in the United States but grew up in Argentina, agreed. \"If I have to save pesos [the local currency] there is not much problem, but I will think twice before I deposit dollars in a bank\".\\n',\n",
       " 'Disney settles disclosure charges\\n \\n Walt Disney has settled charges from US federal regulators that it failed to disclose how family members of directors were employed by the company.\\n \\n The media giant was not fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, but has agreed to refrain from any future violations of securities law. Disney failed to tell investors that between 1999 and 2001 it employed three adult children of three then directors. The firm has neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement.\\n \\n The three Disney directors in question in the central matter of the SEC\\'s investigation - Reveta Bowers, Stanley Gold and Raymond Watson - have all since left the company, with Ms Bowers and Mr Watson both retiring, and Mr Gold quitting in 2003. Their children were paid between $60,000 (Â£30,800) and $150,000 a year, with shareholders not being informed. The SEC also found that Disney did not disclose that a 50% Disney-owned subsidiary company - Lifetime - employed the wife of current Disney director John Bryson, and that she earned more than $1m a year. Louise Bryson remains with Lifetime.\\n \\n Disney also failed to disclose payments to Air Shamrock, an airline owned by Mr Gold and fellow former Disney directors Roy Disney. Finally, Disney also did not reveal that it provided more than $200,000 annually for office space, secretarial services, and a leased car and driver to former director Thomas Murphy. \"Shareholders have a significant interest in information regarding relationships between the company and its directors,\" said SEC deputy enforcement director Linda Thomsen. \"Failure to comply with the SEC\\'s disclosure rules in this area impedes shareholders\\' ability to evaluate the objectivity and independence of directors.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Putin backs state grab for Yukos\\n \\n Russia\\'s president has defended the purchase of Yukos\\' key production unit by state-owned oil firm Rosneft, saying it followed free market principles.\\n \\n Vladimir Putin said it was quite within the rights of a state-owned company to ensure its interests were met. Rosneft bought 100% of Baikal Finance Group, in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of Russia\\'s booming oil industry. Rosneft will now control about 16% of Russia\\'s total crude oil output. Yukos share jumped in Moscow, climbing as much as 50% before being suspended.\\n \\n Rosneft is already in the process of merging with Gazprom, the world\\'s biggest gas company, a move that will see Gazprom return to majority state-ownership.\\n \\n Baikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant Yukos\\'s main production division at a forced auction on Sunday. \"Everything was done by market methods,\" Mr Putin said at his year-end press conference in Moscow. Shedding some light on the Kremlin\\'s motivation, Mr Putin referred to a period of so-called \"cowboy capitalism\" that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union.\\n \\n He said privatisations carried out in the early 1990s had involved trickery, including law breaking, by people seeking to acquire valuable state property. \"Now the state, using market methods, is safeguarding its interests. I think this is quite normal,\" the Russian president said. A Rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a \"balanced, national energy corporation.\"\\n \\n The latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed Yukos, one of Russia\\'s biggest companies to the brink of collapse. The Russian government put Yukos\\'s Yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a $27bn (Â£14bn) bill for back taxes and fines.\\n \\n Analysts say that Yukos\\'s legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the US are probably what caused this week\\'s cloak-and-dagger dealings. Gazprom, the company originally tipped to buy Yuganskneftegas, was banned from taking part in the auction by a US court injunction. By selling the Yukos unit to little-known Baikal and then to Rosneft, Russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines, analysts said. \"You cannot sue the Russian government,\" said Eric Kraus, a strategist at Moscow\\'s Sovlink Securities. \"The Russian government has sovereign immunity.\" \"The government is renationalising Yuganskneftegas.\"\\n \\n Even so, analysts reckon that the saga still has a long way to go. The Rosneft announcement came just hours after Yukos accused Gazprom of illegally taking part in Sunday\\'s auction. It has said it will be seeking damages of $20bn. The claim was made at the latest hearing in the US bankruptcy court in Houston, Texas, where Yukos, had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. If found in contempt of the US court order blocking the auction, Gazprom could face having foreign assets seized. Yukos\\' lawyers had also been expected to try to have Baikal\\'s assets frozen. Lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because Yukos - with an office in Houston - had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of US law which has worldwide jurisdiction. Further muddying the waters is a merger between Rosneft and Gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned.\\n',\n",
       " \"Troubled Marsh under SEC scrutiny\\n \\n The US stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker Marsh & McLennan's shareholder transactions, the firm has said.\\n \\n The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of 5% or more of the firm's shares. Marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the SEC investigation. Marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the New York attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market. Since that inquiry was launched in October, Marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board. Prosecutors allege that Marsh - the world's biggest insurance broker - and other US insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover. This is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by New York's top law officer, Eliot Spitzer, and a separate prosecution of five insurers by the State of California. The SEC's investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the Trident Funds, managed by MMC Capital, the company's private equity firm. Marsh's new chief executive, Michael Cherkasky, is trying to negotiate a settlement with Mr Spitzer. Mr Spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner against corporate America's misdeeds.\\n \\n The uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch - to downgrade Marsh in recent weeks. According to the Financial Times, insurance analysts are now questioning whether Marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year. Doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind.\\n\",\n",

Its withdrawal from the $325m (Â£170m) contract in November is thought to be the largest cancellation to date. Contrack said \"the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner\". But the firm denied reports it was withdrawing completely from Iraq. \"Members of the joint venture including Contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts, are actively working in Iraq and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country,\" it said in a statement. The Pentagon\\'s Project and Contract Office (PCO) in Baghdad said it had taken over Contrack\\'s management of the subcontractors working on the transportation projects.\\n \\n US firms and their workers have been targets of attacks, and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in Iraq. Of the $18.4bn in reconstruction funds approved by Congress, less than $2bn has been spent. Lt Col Eric Schnaible of the PCO told the Associated Press news agency Contrack\\'s withdrawal from the transportation contract was a \"mutually agreed-to separation\" and did not indicate a movement by US companies to leave Iraq. \"Some parts of the country are a whole lot more permissive than others,\" he added. \"Where we can get the work done, good things are happening.\"\\n',\n",

Asia\\'s biggest airline joins Japanese rival All Nippon as one of the first carriers to order the mid-size 7E7, which Boeing says is super-economical. Airbus this week announced the first pre-sale of its 7E7 rival - the A350. Boeing\\'s great European competitor is to sell 10 of its forthcoming A350 to Spanish carrier Air Europe, which has the option to buy two more in a deal that could be worth more than $1.8bn. Both the 7E7 and the A350 are being designed to be as fuel-efficient as possible in the 200- to 300-seat sector, and each will be available in both short and long range versions.\\n \\n Japan Airlines said it had looked at both aircraft before choosing the 7E7, also known as the Dreamliner. \"We chose the 7E7 after carefully considering both it and Airbus\\' aircraft,\" said a Japan Airlines spokesman. \"The 7E7 fits better for what we needed and it could be delivered when we hoped to get it.\" Boeing continues to enjoy a dominance over Airbus in Japan, and Japanese companies are taking key roles in building the 7E7. The first 7E7s will be delivered to Japan Airlines in April 2008. Boeing has set itself a target of getting 200 firm commitments for the 7E7 by the end of this year, and has orders for 56 so far.

But the 42-year-old won her claim of unfair dismissal, resulting from her sacking in August 2003. Her partial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about Â£55,000, a tiny fraction of what she asked for. The extent of damages will be assessed in the New Year. The action - the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the UK - had been viewed as something of a test case.\\n \\n The tribunal decided that Ms Villalba had been unfairly dismissed because, having been removed from a senior post, she was entitled to wait to see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation. Ms Villalba, the former head of Merrill\\'s private client business in Europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal.\\n \\n A spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as \"very disappointing\", but pointed to some criticism of Merrill\\'s procedures within the lengthy judgement. The tribunal upheld Ms Villalba\\'s claim of victimisation on certain specific issues, including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract, but said it found no evidence of \"laddish culture\" at the bank. \"We said from the start that this case was about performance not gender,\" Merrill said in a statement. \"Ms Villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman. \"Merrill Lynch is dedicated to creating a true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity to advance based on their skills and hard work.\"\\n \\n Based in London\\'s financial district, Ms Villalba worked for Merrill\\'s global private client business in Europe, investing funds for some of Merrill\\'s most important customers. But in 2003 her employers told her she had no future after 17 years with the company, and she was made redundant. Merrill Lynch denied Ms Villalba\\'s claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent.

China has been a net importer of oil since the mid 1990's with more than a third of the oil and gas it consumes coming from abroad. A lack of sufficient domestic production and the need to lessen its dependence on imports from the Middle East has meant that China is looking to invest in other potential markets such as Latin America. Mr Chavez, who is visiting China, said his country would put its many of its oil facilities at the disposal of China. Chinese firms would be allowed to operate 15 mature oil fields in the east of Venezuela, which could produce more than one billion barrels, he confirmed.

Internationally recognized regulation is now a key part of China's plans for developing its economy, analysts said. Beijing also has been threatened with sanctions if it fails to clamp down.\\n \\n Chinese firms copy products ranging from computer software and spark plugs to baby milk and compact discs. Despite the fact that product piracy is a major problem, foreign companies have only occasionally won cases and the compensation awarded has usually been small. Still, recent rulings and announcements will have boosted optimism that attitudes are changing. Earlier this week China said that in future it will punish violators of intellectual property rights with up to seven years in jail. And on Tuesday, Paws Incorporated - the owner of the rights to Garfield the cat - won a court battle against a publishing house that violated its copyright. Other firms that have taken legal action in China, with varying degrees of success, include Yamaha, General Motors and Toyota.\\n \\n The problem of piracy is not limited to China, however, and the potential for profit is huge. The European Union estimates that the global trade in pirated wares is worth more than 200bn euros a year (Â£140bn; $258bn), or about 5% of total world trade. And it is growing. Between 1998 and 2002, the number of counterfeit or pirated goods intercepted at the EU's external borders increased by more than 800%, it said. Last month the EU said it will start monitoring China, Ukraine and Russia to ensure they are going after pirated goods. Other countries on the EU's hit list include Thailand, Brazil, South Korea and Indonesia. Any countries that are not making enough of an effort could be dragged to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), a step that could trigger economic sanctions, the EU warned.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Air Jamaica back in state control\\n \\n The Jamaican government is regaining control of Air Jamaica in an bid to help the ailing company out of its financial difficulties.\\n \\n The firm has failed to make money since the state sold a majority stake to hotel tycoon Gordon Stewart in 1994. In common with many carriers, Air Jamaica, with debts of $560m (Â£291m), has been hit by high fuel costs and the impact of the 11 September attacks. The company will be restructured with the aim of finding a new buyer. \"The administration is committed to a viable national airline that will serve as a major catalyst for our economy,\" said Finance Minister Omar Davies. The 35-year-old airline transports about 55% of all passengers to the island and its pilots are reportedly among the best paid in the industry, with senior members of staff earning in excess of $234,000 a year.\\n',\n",
       " 'Battered dollar hits another low\\n \\n The dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the US economy.\\n \\n The greenback hit $1.3516 in thin New York trade, before rallying to $1.3509. The dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded about $1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the US trade and budget deficits. Meanwhile, France\\'s finance minister has said the world faced \"economic catastrophe\" unless the US worked with Europe and Asia on currency controls. Herve Gaymard said he would seek action on the issue at the next meeting of G7 countries in February. Ministers from European and Asian governments have recently called on the US to strengthen the dollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies. \"It\\'s absolutely essential that at the meeting of the G7 our American friends understand that we need coordinated management at the world level,\" said Mr Gaymard.\\n \\n Thursday\\'s new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the US had fallen 12% in November - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity.\\n \\n Commerce Department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the US economy - grew just 0.2% last month. The figure was weaker than forecast - and fell short of the 0.8% rise in October. The official US policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters.\\n \\n The US government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from \"abnormal and dangerous heights\" set in 2002. The US says it will let market forces determine the dollar\\'s strength rather than intervene directly. Statements from President Bush in recent weeks highlighting his aim to cut the twin US deficits have prompted slight upturns in the currency. But while some observers said the quiet trade on Thursday had exacerbated small moves in the market, most agree the underlying trend remains downwards. The dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further, albeit less dramatic weakening, in 2005. \"I can see it finishing the year around $1.35 and we can see that it\\'s going to be a steady track upward for the euro/dollar in 2005, finishing the year around $1.40,\" said Adrian Hughes, currency strategist with HSBC in London.\\n',\n",
       " 'Quake\\'s economic costs emerging\\n \\n Asian governments and international agencies are reeling at the potential economic devastation left by the Asian tsunami and floods.\\n \\n World Bank president James Wolfensohn has said his agency is \"only beginning to grasp the magnitude of the disaster\" and its economic impact. The tragedy has left at least 25,000 people dead, with Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and Indonesia worst hit. Some early estimates of reconstruction costs are starting to emerge. Millions have been left homeless, while businesses and infrastructure have been washed away.\\n \\n Economists believe several of the 10 countries hit by the giant waves could see a slowdown in growth.\\n \\n In Sri Lanka, some observers have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. For Thailand, that figure is much lower at 0.1%. Governments are expected to take steps, such as cutting taxes and increasing spending, to facilitate a recovery.\\n \\n \"With the enormous displacement of people...there will be a serious relaxation of fiscal policy,\" Glenn Maguire, chief economist for the region at Societe Generale, told Agence France Presse. \"The economic impact of it will certainly be large, but it should not be enough to derail the momentum of the region in 2005,\" he said. \"First and foremost this is a human tragedy.\" India\\'s economy, however, is less likely to slow because the areas hit are some of the least developed. The regional giant has enjoyed strong growth in 2004. But India now faces other problems, with aid workers under pressure to ensure a clean supply of water and sanitation to prevent an outbreak of disease.\\n \\n Thailand\\'s Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has estimated the destruction at 20bn baht ($510m). Analysts said that figure is likely to rise and the country\\'s tourist industry is likely to be hardest hit. Thailand\\'s fishing and real estate sectors also will be affected by Sunday\\'s 9.0 magnitude earthquake, which sent huge waves from Malaysia to Africa. Malaysia said as many as 1,000 fishermen will be affected and that damage to the industry will be \"significant\", Agence France Presse reported. Rapid rebuilding will be key to limiting the impact of the tragedy. \"In three months, we should rebuild 70% of the damage in the three worst hit provinces,\" said Juthamas Siriwan, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand. The outlook for Sri Lanka is less optimistic, with analysts predicting that the country\\'s tourist industry will struggle to recovery quickly. Tourism is a vital to many developing countries, providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east Asian region, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).\\n',\n",
       " 'Disaster claims \\'less than $10bn\\'\\n \\n Insurers have sought to calm fears that they face huge losses after an earthquake and giant waves killed at least 38,000 people in southern Asia.\\n \\n Munich Re and Swiss Re, the world\\'s two biggest reinsurers, have said exposure will be less than for other disasters. Rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries, and many of those affected will not have insurance, analysts said. Swiss Re has said total claims are likely to be less than $10bn (Â£5.17bn). Swiss Re believes that the cost would be substantial but that it is unlikely to be in double-digit billions, the Financial Times reported. Munich Re, the world\\'s largest reinsurance company, said that its exposure is less than 100m euros (Â£70m; $136m).\\n \\n At least 10 countries have been affected, with Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India and Thailand among the worst hit. The region\\'s resorts and Western tourists are expected to be among the main claimants.\\n \\n Lloyds of London told the Financial Times it expected its exposure to be limited to \"holiday resorts, personal accident, travel insurance and marine risks\". A spokeswoman for Hanover Re, Europe\\'s fifth-largest reinsurance firm, estimated tsunami-related damage claims would be in the low double-digit millions of euros. The company has paid out about 300 million euros (Â£281m; $400m) to cover damage caused recently by four major hurricanes in the US.\\n \\n But insurers have not had long to assess the economic impact of the damage and reports of more casualties and destruction are still coming through.\\n \\n \"So many things are unclear, it is just too early to tell,\" said Serge Troeber, deputy head of Swiss Re\\'s natural disasters department. \"You need very complicated processes to estimate damages. Unlike the hurricanes, you can\\'t just run a model.\" He anticipated that his own company\\'s total claims would be less then those from the hurricanes, which the company put at $640m. Allianz, a leading German insurer, said it did not know yet what its exposure would be. However, it said the tidal waves were unlikely to have a \"significant\" impact on its business. Zurich Financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster.\\n \\n The impact on US insurance companies is not expected to be heavy, analysts said.\\n \\n Most US insurers have relatively little exposure to Asia and those that do, pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds. Insured damage could be a fraction of the \"billions of dollars worth of destruction in Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Indonesia, the Maldive Islands and Malaysia,\" said Prudential Equity Group insurance analyst Jay Gelb. \"US insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure. It\\'s more likely the Bermuda-based reinsurance [companies] might have some exposure,\" said Paul Newsome, an insurance analyst at AG Edwards & Co.\\n \\n Many of the affected countries, such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka or the Maldives, do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters, said a US-based insurance expert. Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia and Thailand, at about $5bn (Â£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered to Central America after Hurricane Mitch.\\n \\n Mitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998. But the cost of the tsunamis on the individuals involved is incalculable. \"We cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the nameless fishermen and fishing villages ... that have just been wiped out. Hundreds of thousands of livelihoods have gone,\" said Jan Egeland, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Tourists cutting short their holidays in affected areas may suffer a financial impact too. The Association of British insurers warned that travel insurance does not normally cover cutting short a holiday. It said loss of possessions will usually be covered, but the Association stressed the importance of checking the wording of travel policies.\\n',\n",
       " 'India-Pakistan peace boosts trade\\n \\n Calmer relations between India and Pakistan are paying economic dividends, with new figures showing bilateral trade up threefold in the summer.\\n \\n The value of trade in April-July rose to $186.3m (Â£97m) from $64.4m in the same period in 2003, the Indian Government said. Nonethless, the figures represent less than 1% of India\\'s overall exports. But business is expected to be boosted further from 2006 when the South Asian Free Trade Area Agreement starts. Both countries eased travel and other restrictions as part of the peace process aimed at ending nearly six decades of hostilities.\\n \\n Sugar, plastics, pharmaceutical products and tea are among the major exports from India to its neighbour, while firms in Pakistani have been selling fabrics, fruit and spices. \"If the positive trend continues, two-way trade could well cross half a billion dollars this fiscal year,\" India\\'s federal commerce Minister Kamal Nath said. According to official data, the value of India\\'s overall exports in the current fiscal year is expected to reach more than $60bn, while in Pakistan\\'s case it is set to hit more than $12bn. Meanwhile, the Indian Government said the prospects for the country\\'s booming economy remained \"very bright\" despite a \"temporary aberration\" this year. Its mid-year economic review forecasts growth of 6-6.5% in 2004, compared with 8.2% in 2003. Higher oil prices, the level of tax collections, and an unfavourable monsoon season affecting the farm sector had hurt the economy in April-September, it said.\\n',\n",
       " 'US to probe airline travel chaos\\n \\n The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines\\' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.\\n \\n Staff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered. US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.\\n \\n Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair\\'s computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand \"what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath\".\\n \\n Adding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways\\' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate \"sickout\". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.\\n \\n US Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.\\n \\n \"US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,\" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was \"embarrassed by the situation\" and \"deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,\" The probe will focus on the industry\\'s compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway\\'s ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair \"deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline\\'s crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,\" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.\\n',\n",
       " 'S Korean lender faces liquidation\\n \\n Creditors of South Korea\\'s top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.\\n \\n LG Card\\'s creditors have given LG group until Wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. The firm avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $4.5bn bail-out in January 2004, which gave control to the creditors. LG Group has said any package should reflect the firm\\'s new ownership, and it will not accept an unfair burden. At least seven million people in South Korea use LG Card\\'s plastic for purchases.\\n \\n LG Card\\'s creditors have threatened parent group LG Group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.\\n \\n \"Creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against LG Group if LG Card is liquidated,\" said Yoo Ji-chang, governor of Korean Development Bank (KDB) - one of the card firm\\'s major creditors. LG Group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. It says it wants \"fair and reasonable guidelines\" on splitting the financial burden with the creditors, who now own 99.3% of LG Card. The creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets, KDB said. Analysts believe a compromise is likely. \"LG Group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of LG Card,\" said Kim Yungmin, an equity strategist at Dongwon Investment Trust Management.\\n \\n LG Card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble. The firm returned to profit in September 2004, but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the Korea Stock Exchange. The exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running. LG card\\'s creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm, which owes about $12.05bn. \"Eventually, LG Group will have to participate, but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions,\" said Mr Kim.\\n',\n",
       " 'Dollar hits new low versus euro\\n \\n The US dollar has continued its record-breaking slide and has tumbled to a new low against the euro.\\n \\n Investors are betting that the European Central Bank (ECB) will not do anything to weaken the euro, while the US is thought to favour a declining dollar. The US is struggling with a ballooning trade deficit and analysts said one of the easiest ways to fund it was by allowing a depreciation of the dollar. They have predicted that the dollar is likely to fall even further.\\n \\n The US currency was trading at $1.364 per euro at 1800 GMT on Monday. This compares with $1.354 to the euro in late trading in New York on Friday, which was then a record low.\\n \\n The dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded about $1.20 against the euro. It has lost 7% this year, while against the Japanese yen it is down 3.2%. Traders said that thin trading levels had amplified Monday\\'s move. \"It\\'s not going to take much to push [the dollar] one way or the other,\" said Grant Wilson of Mellon Bank. Liquidity - a measure of the number of parties willing to trade in the market - was about half that of a normal working day, traders said.\\n',\n",

Nonetheless, US crude is still 30% more expensive than at the beginning of 2004, boosted by growing demand and bottlenecks at refineries. Traders ignored the possible effects of Asia\\'s tidal waves on global supplies.\\n \\n Instead, the focus is now on US consumption, which is heavily influenced in the short term by the weather. \"With the revised milder temperatures... I\\'m more inclined to think we\\'ll push lower and test the $40-40.25 range,\" said John Brady of ABN AMRO. \"The market definitely feels to be on the defensive.\" Statistics released last week showed that stockpiles of oil products in the US had risen, an indication that severe supply disruptions may not arise this winter, barring any serious incident. Oil prices have broken records in 2004, topping $50 a barrel at one point, driven up by a welter of worries about unrest in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, rising demand and supply bottlenecks. London\\'s International Petroleum Exchange remained closed for the Christmas holiday.\\n',\n",
       " 'Share boost for feud-hit Reliance\\n \\n The board of Indian conglomerate Reliance has agreed a share buy-back, to counter the effects of a power struggle in the controlling family.\\n \\n The buy-back is a victory for chairman Mukesh Ambani, whose idea it was. His brother Anil, the vice-chairman, said had not been consulted and that the buy-back was \"completely inappropriate and unnecessary\". The board hopes the move will reverse a 13% fall in Reliance\\'s shares since the feud became public last month. The company has been fractious since founder Dhirubhai Ambani died in 2002, leaving no will. \"Today\\'s round has gone to [Mukesh], there is no doubt about it,\" said Nanik Rupani, president of the Indian Merchants Chamber, a Bombay-based traders\\' body.

       " 'Giant waves damage S Asia economy\\n \\n Governments, aid agencies, insurers and travel firms are among those counting the cost of the massive earthquake and waves that hammered southern Asia.\\n \\n The worst-hit areas are Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia and Thailand, with at least 23,000 people killed. Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed at about $5bn (Â£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered Central America after Hurricane Mitch. Mitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998. World Bank spokesman Damien Milverton told the Wall Street Journal that he expected an aid package of financing and debt relief.\\n \\n Tourism is a vital part of the economies of the stricken countries, providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east Asian region, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). In the Maldives islands, in the Indian ocean, two-thirds of all jobs depend on tourism.\\n \\n But the damage covers fishing, farming and businesses too, with hundreds of thousands of buildings and small boats destroyed by the waves. International agencies have pledged their support; most say it is impossible to gauge the extent of the damage yet. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope.\\n \\n \"The IMF stands ready to do its part to assist these nations with appropriate support in their time of need,\" said managing director Rodrigo Rato. Only Sri Lanka and Bangladesh currently receive IMF support, while Indonesia, the quake\\'s epicentre, has recently graduated from IMF assistance. It is up to governments to decide if they want IMF help. Other agencies, such as the Asian Development Bank, have said that it is too early to comment on the amount of aid needed. There is no underestimating the size of the problem, however. The United Nations\\' emergency relief coordinator, Jan Egeland, said that \"this may be the worst national disaster in recent history because it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas... so many vulnerable communities. \"Many people will have [had] their livelihoods, their whole future destroyed in a few seconds.\" He warned that \"the longer term effects many be as devastating as the tidal wave or the tsunami itself\" because of the risks of epidemics from polluted drinking water.\\n \\n Insurers are also struggling to assess the cost of the damage, but several big players believe the final bill is likely to be less than the $27bn cost of the hurricanes that battered the US earlier this year.\\n \\n \"The region that\\'s affected is very big so we have to check country-by-country what the situation is\", said Serge Troeber, deputy head of the natural disasters department at Swiss Re, the world\\'s second biggest reinsurance firm. \"I should assume, however, that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the US,\" he said. Munich Re, the world\\'s biggest reinsurer, said: \"This is primarily a human tragedy. It is too early for us to state what our financial burden will be.\" Allianz has said it sees no significant impact on its profitability. However, a low insurance bill may simply reflect the general poverty of much of the region, rather than the level of economic devastation for those who live there.\\n \\n The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies told the Reuters news agency that it was seeking $6.5m for emergency aid.\\n \\n \"The biggest health challenges we face is the spread of waterborne diseases, particularly malaria and diarrhoea,\" the aid agency was quoted as saying. The European Union has said it will deliver 3m euros (Â£2.1m; $4.1m) of aid, according to the Wall Street Journal. The EU\\'s Humanitarian Aid Commissioner, Louis Michel, was quoted as saying that it was key to bring aid \"in those vital hours and days immediately after the disaster\". Other countries also are reported to have pledged cash, while the US State Department said it was examining what aid was needed in the region. Getting companies and business up and running also may play a vital role in helping communities recover from the weekend\\'s events.\\n \\n Many of the worst-hit areas, such as Sri Lanka, Thailand\\'s Phuket island and the Maldives, are popular tourist resorts that are key to local economies.\\n \\n December and January are two of the busiest months for the travel in southern Asia and the damage will be even more keenly felt as the industry was only just beginning to emerge from a post 9/11 slump. Growth has been rapid in southeast Asia, with the World Tourism Organisation figures showing a 45% increase in tourist revenues in the region during the first 10 months of 2004. In southern Asia that expansion is 23%. \"India continues to post excellent results thanks to increased promotion and product development, but also to the upsurge in business travel driven by the rapid economic development of the country,\" the WTO said. \"Arrivals to other destinations such as... Maldives and Sri Lanka also thrived.\" In Thailand, tourism accounts for about 6% of the country\\'s annual gross domestic product, or about $8bn. In Singapore the figure is close to 5%. Tourism also brings in much needed foreign currency. In the short-term, however, travel companies are cancelling flights and trips. That has hit shares across Asia and Europe, with investors saying that earnings and economic growth are likely to slow.\\n',\n",
       " 'Asia shares defy post-quake gloom\\n \\n Thailand has become the first of the 10 southern Asian nations battered by giant waves at the weekend to cut its economic forecast.\\n \\n Thailand\\'s economy is now expected to grow by 5.7% in 2005, rather than 6% as forecast before tsunamis hit six tourist provinces. The full economic costs of the disaster remain unclear. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. But Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs on Wednesday, suggesting that investors do not fear a major economic impact.\\n \\n The highs showed the gap in outlook between investors in large firms and individuals who have lost their livelihoods.\\n \\n Investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas - such as Aceh in Indonesia - were so under-developed that the tragedy would little impact on Asia\\'s listed companies, according to analysts. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing. But it\\'s not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense,\" said ABN Amro chief Asian strategist Eddie Wong. India\\'s Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka\\'s stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\\n \\n Thailand may lose 30bn baht (Â£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\\n \\n In the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry\\'s fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won\\'t be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage. However, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact.\\n',\n",

The economy is benefiting from a quieter period in Palestinian-Israeli violence and a pick-up in global demand for technology products. The outlook is better than it has been for a number of years, analysts said.\\n \\n Many companies have focused on cost cutting and greater efficiency, while the government has been trying to trim public spending and push through reforms. The growth figures come about despite a strike earlier this year by about 400,000 public sector worker which closed banks, hospitals, postal services and transport facilities. Growth did slow in the second half, but only slightly. Exports for the year rose by 14%, while tourist revenues were up by 30%.

It aims to create 400,000 jobs and will focus on infrastructure and home building, as well as providing public firms with money to hire new workers.\\n \\n The government has set an economic growth rate target of 5% for next year and hinted that would be in danger unless it took action. \"Internal and external economic conditions are likely to remain unfavourable in 2005,\" the Finance and Economy Ministry said in a statement.\\n \\n It blamed \"continuing uncertainties such as fluctuating oil prices and foreign exchange rates and stagnant domestic demand that has shown few signs of a quick rebound\". In 2004, growth will be between 4.7% and 4.8%, the ministry said. Not everyone is convinced the plan will work. \"Our primary worry centres on the what we believe is the government\\'s overly optimistic view that its front loading of the budget will be enough to turn the economy around,\" consultancy 4Cast said in a report.\\n \\n The problem facing South Korea is that many consumers are reeling from the effects of a credit bubble that only recently burst.

It also pledged to look at ways of helping families on low incomes.\\n \\n The government voiced concern about the effect of redundancies in the building trade. \"Given the economic spill over and employment effect in the construction sector, a sharp downturn in the construction industry could have other adverse effects,\" the ministry said.\\n \\n As a result, South Korea will give private companies also will be given the chance to build schools, hospitals, houses and other public buildings. It also will look at real estate tax system. Other plans on the table include promoting new industries such as bio-technology and nano-technology, as well as offering increased support to small and medium sized businesses. \"The focus will be on job creation and economic recovery, given that unfavourable domestic and global conditions are likely to dog the Korean economy in 2005,\" the ministry said.\\n',\n",

The organisation has found itself in trouble after being accused of helping to topple Georgia\\'s former president. It denies having any role, but offices have had to close across the region.\\n \\n The OSI shut its office in Moscow last year and has withdrawn from Uzbekistan and Belarus. In the Ukraine earlier this year, Mr Soros - who took on the Bank of England in the 1990s - and won, was pelted by protestors. \"This legal prosecution can be considered an attempt by the government to force Soros Foundation-Kazakhstan to cease its activities in Kazakhstan and shut its doors for Kazakh citizens and organisations,\" the OSI said.\\n \\n The OSI aims to promote democratic and open, market-based societies. Since the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kazakhstan has been dominated by its president Nursultan Abish-uly Nazarbayev. He has powers for life, while insulting the president and officials has been made a criminal offence. The government controls the printing presses and most radio and TV transmission facilities. It operates the country\\'s national radio and TV networks. Recent elections were criticised as flawed and the opposition claimed there was widespread vote rigging. Supporters, however, say he brings much needed stability to a region where Islamic militancy is on the rise.

       " 'Deutsche attacks Yukos case\\n \\n German investment bank Deutsche Bank has challenged the right of Yukos to claim bankruptcy protection in the US.\\n \\n In a court filing on Tuesday, it said the Russian oil giant has few Texas ties beyond bank accounts and a Texas-based finance chief. Deutsche Bank claimed Yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset. It had wanted to help fund Gazprom\\'s plans for a $10bn (Â£5.18bn) bid for Yukos unit Yuganskneftegas.\\n \\n Deutsche Bank would have earned large fees from the deal, which could not be carried out because US chapter 11 bankruptcy rules made the Kremlin\\'s auction of Yuganskneftegas on 19 December illegal under US law.\\n \\n But the US bankruptcy court judge in Texas granted Yukos an injunction that barred Gazprom and its lenders from taking part. Yuganskneftegas will ultimately end up with Gazprom. The winning bidder at the auction was a previously unknown firm, Baikal Finance Group, which was snapped up days later by Rosneft, a Russian oil firm that is in the process of merging with Gazprom. The effect of these transactions is to renationalise Yuganskneftegas. Deutsche Bank contends Yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in Texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the 19 December auction of its top unit by the Russian government, which was in a tax dispute with Yukos.\\n \\n \"This blatant attempt to artificially manufacture a basis for jurisdiction constitutes cause to dismiss this case,\" Deutsche Bank said in its court filing. Mike Lake, a spokesman for Yukos\\' lawyers, said on Tuesday that the company stands by its legal action. Yukos is confident of its right to US bankruptcy protection, and \"we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again,\" he said. Yukos has said it intends to seek $20bn in damages from the buyer of Yuganskneftegas once the sale finally goes through. In its filing, Deutsche Bank said Houston was \"a jurisdiction in which Yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations.\"\\n \\n It also said the US bankruptcy court should not become involved in \"a tax dispute between the Federation and one of its corporate citizens\". It suggested the European Court or an international arbitration tribunal were more appropriate jurisdictions for the legal fight between Russia and Yukos. The next hearing in the bankruptcy is expected on 6 January. Analysts believe the tax dispute between the Russian government and Yukos is partly driven by Russian president Vladimir Putin\\'s hostility hostility to the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khordokovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail, and on trial for fraud and tax evasion.\\n',\n",

Press reports have speculated that Fiat may be willing to accept a cash payment in return for dropping its claim. Both companies want to cut costs as the car industry adjusts to waning demand.\\n \\n The meeting between Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne and GM\\'s Rick Wagoner is due to take place at 1330 GMT in Zurich, according to the Reuters news agency.\\n \\n Mr Marchionne is confident of his firm\\'s legal position, saying in an interview with the Financial Times that GM\\'s argument \"has no legs\". The agreement in question dates back to GM\\'s decision to buy 20% of Fiat\\'s auto division in 2000. At the time, it gave the Italian firm the right, via a \\'put option\\', to sell the remaining stake to GM. In recent weeks, Fiat has reiterated its claims that this \\'put\\' is still valid and legally binding. However, GM argues that a Fiat share sale made last year, which cut GM\\'s holding to 10%, together with asset sales made by Fiat have terminated the agreement.\\n \\n Selling the Fiat\\'s car-making unit may not prove so simple, analysts say, especially as it is a company that is so closely linked to Italy\\'s industrial heritage. Political and public pressure may well push the two firms to reach a compromise. \"We are not expecting Fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling GM at this point,\" brokerage Merrill Lynch said in a note to investors, adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business. \"As far as we are aware, the Agnelli family, which indirectly controls at least 30% of Fiat, has not given a firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business. \"Fiat may be willing to cancel the \\'put\\' in exchange for money.\"\\n',\n",

The copper price reached a 16-year high in October 2004. Production in Chile is expected rise 3.5% in 2005 to 5.5 million tonnes, said Mr Cartagena. Cochilco expects for 2005 a slight reduction on copper prices and forecasts export earnings will fall 10.7%.\\n',\n",

The Conference Board survey of 5,000 households pointed to renewed optimism about job creation and economic growth. US retailers have reported strong sales over the past 10 days after a slow start to the crucial festive season.\\n \\n According to figures also released on Tuesday, sales in shopping malls in the week to 25 December were 4.3% higher than in 2003 following a last minute rush. Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has said its December sales are expected to be better than previously forecast because of strong post-Christmas sales.\\n \\n It is expecting annual sales growth of between 1% and 3% for the month. Consumer confidence figures are considered a key economic indicator because consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the United States. \"The continuing economic expansion, combined with job growth, has consumers ending this year on a high note,\" said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board\\'s consumer research centre. \"And consumers\\' outlook suggests that the economy will continue to expand in the first half of next year.\" The overall US economy has performed strongly in recent months, prompting the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates five times since June.\\n',\n",

The switch over took place as she paid for her groceries in the supermarket chain Tesco\\'s Cromwell Road branch.\\n \\n Mrs Carroll was born in the same year that plastic cards first appeared in the UK. \"I pay for most things with my debit card, with occasional purchases on one of my credit cards,\" said Mrs Carroll, who teaches at Peel Common Infants School in Gosport.\\n \\n Spending patterns for the year and estimates for December led Apacs to conclude that 10.38am was the time that plastic would finally rule the roost. Shoppers in the UK are expected to put Â£269bn on plastic cards during the whole of 2004, compared with Â£268bn paid with cash, Apacs said. When the first plastic cards appeared in the UK in June 1966, issued by Barclaycard, but only a handful of retailers accepted them and very few customers held them. \"But in less than 40 years, plastic has become our most popular way to pay, due to the added security and flexibility it offers,\" said Apacs spokeswoman Jemma Smith. \"The key driver has been the introduction of debit cards, which now account for two-thirds of plastic card transactions and are used by millions of us every day.\"\\n',\n",

The 912km pipeline will run from the Bulgarian port of Burgas, over the Black Sea to the Albanian city of Vlore on the Adriatic coast, crossing Macedonia.\\n \\n The project was conceived in 1994 but it was delayed because of the lack of political support.

According to Pat Ferguson, President of AMBO, work on the pipeline will begin in 2005 and it is expected to be ready in three or four years. He added that the company had already raised about $900m from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) - a US development agency - the Eximbank and Credit Suisse First Boston, among others. The project has also the support of the European Union.

An spokesman for SSL, which makes the famous Durex brand of condom, would not to comment on \"market speculation\". However the news sent shares in SSL, which also makes Scholl footwear, up more than 6%, or 16.75 pence to 293.5p.\\n \\n The FT said most the high-profile firm that might woo SSL was Anglo-Dutch household products group Reckitt Benckiser. Eighteen months ago Reckitt Benckiser was at the centre of a rumoured takeover bid for SSL - but that came to nothing.

Some observers see this as another step closer to a full public listing. However Nasdaq, an icon of the 1990s technology boom, recently poured cold water on those suggestions.\\n \\n The company first sold shares in private placements during 2000 and 2001.

A report from investment firm Grant Samuel in WMC defence documents values WMC shares at A$7.17 to A$8.24, against Xstrata\\'s bid of A$6.35 a share. Analysts said the defence documents provided more details on WMC, and may trigger a possible rival bid. \"If a bid is going to emerge it is probably likely in the next one to two weeks,\" said Daiwa Securities analyst Mark Pervan. He said the valuation would put increased pressure on Xstrata to look at \"sweetening\" its offer. Marc Gonsalves, an executive at Xstrata, said: \"We will review the information contained in the target\\'s statement over the next week or so.\" He added: \"While we will review the assumptions made by Grant Samuel in detail, we are extremely sceptical of their conclusion, and suggest that WMC shareholders take extreme care in presuming that these optimistic assumptions are capable of being realised.\"\\n \\n Last month Australia\\'s competition watchdog said it would not oppose the purchase of WMC by Zurich and London-based Xstrata. On Tuesday, WMC chairman Tommie Bergman said in a statement the directors believed it was in shareholders\\' best interest to reject the offer. He said WMC would pursue \"value-creating options\" provided by a portfolio of \"world class assets\". And WMC chief executive Andrew Michelmore claimed the Xstrata offer was aimed at creating value for Xstrata\\'s shareholders, and was not being made for the benefit of WMC\\'s shareholders. Grant Samuel said its valuation of WMC was based on lower average prices for nickel, copper and uranium than current market levels. \"Any longer term commodity price improvements would only improve our outlook,\" Mr Michelmore said.\\n \\n In 2003 Xstrata acquired Australia\\'s largest copper miner - MIM Holdings. WMC Resources is the world\\'s third-largest producer of concentrated nickel, and also a miner of copper and uranium.

Mr Murray said the club would find it easier to attract more investment by having a single majority owner. Sunderland delisted its shares from the stock market in August.\\n \\n A lifetime Sunderland supporter and board director since 1984, Mr Murray agreed to buy BSkyB\\'s 4.76% holding in the Wearside club on Tuesday - taking his stake to 42.3%. Under stock market rules, Mr Murray is required to make an offer for the remaining shares that he does not already own at the same price paid for the BSkyB holding of 31p a share.\\n \\n Should the offer be fully accepted, Mr Murray said he expected to pay a maximum of Â£1.53m for the remaining shares. He also stressed that fans who wanted to keep in touch with the club\\'s financial affairs could retain a small number of shares, enabling them to attend annual meetings. \"The football sector is experiencing significant changes and uncertainty,\" Mr Murray said in a statement. \"The recent speculation surrounding Malcolm Glazer and Manchester United has shown the unsettling effect possible where there are a number of disparate interests,\" he added. \"I believe that this offer will strengthen the company and remove the potential for that type of uncertainty.\"\\n \\n Sunderland were relegated from the Premiership in 2003 but are currently pushing for promotion.

Instead of taxpayers having to pick up the bill, the FER wants Congressmen to change the PBGC\\'s funding rules. The FER says firms should not have been allowed to reduce the insurance premiums they pay into the PBGC fund. The FER blames this on a 2004 law, in a statement signed by several members, who include Nobel economics laureate William Sharpe. It said it was \"dismayed\" at the situation and wants Congress to overturn the legislation.\\n \\n Cash-strapped US companies, including those in the airline, car-making and steel industries, had argued in favour of the 2004 rule change, claiming that funding the insurance premiums adequately would force them to have to cut jobs. \"With a little firmer hand on the pensions issues in the US, I think that Congress could avoid having to turn to the taxpayer and instead turn the obligations back onto the companies that deserve to pay them,\" said Professor Dennis Logue, dean of Price College of Business at the University of Oklahoma.

Its comments came after the industry minister of India\\'s Andhra Pradesh state said a team of VW officials were due to visit to discuss the plans. B. Satyanarayana said he expected VW to co-sign a memorandum of agreement. Several foreign carmakers, including Hyundai, Toyota, Suzuki and Ford, already have Indian production facilities to meet demand for automobiles in Asia\\'s fourth-largest economy. VW\\'s proposed plant would be set up in the port city of Visakhapatnam on India\\'s eastern coast. An Andhra Pradesh official added that VW had already approved a factory site measuring 250 acres.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ukraine strikes Turkmen gas deal\\n \\n Ukraine has agreed to pay 30% more for natural gas supplied by Turkmenistan.\\n \\n The deal was sealed three days after Turkmenistan cut off gas supplies in a price dispute that threatened the Ukrainian economy. Supplies from Turkmenistan account for 45% of all natural gas imported by Ukraine, which has large coal deposits but no gas fields. Turkmenistan is also trying to strike a similar deal with Russia, which is not so dependent on its gas. Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov, who signed the contract, said the Turkmen side agreed to lower the price demanded by $2 per 1,000 cubic metres, bringing it down to $58. But the new price is still $14 higher than the price fixed in the contract for 2004. The head of the Ukrainian state-owned Naftohaz company, Yury Boyko, said he was \"fully happy\" with the deal. On Friday, Turkmenistan acted on a threat and shut off gas supplies to Ukraine in attempt to bring the price dispute to a head. Mr Niyazov said that his government would insist on the same price for supplies to Russia. Analysts say thay may not happen as Russia, the world\\'s leading gas producer, needs the cheap Turkmen gas only to relieve is state-owned Gazprom from costly investment in the exploration of oil fields in Siberia. Turkmenistan is the second-largest gas producer in the world.\\n',\n",

Anil, 45, has stepped down as director and vice-chairman of Indian Petrochemicals Corporation (IPC). The company was not available for comment. IPC is 46%-owned by Reliance Industries which in turn is run by Mukesh. Mukesh has spoken of ownership issues between the two brothers, who took over control of the Reliance empire following the death of their father in July, 2002.\\n \\n Reliance's operations have massive reach, covering textiles, telecommunications, petrochemicals, petroleum refining and marketing, as well as oil and gas exploration, insurance and financial services. The brothers' spat has hogged headlines in India during recent weeks, despite a denial from the family that there was anything wrong. Speculation has been rife about what has triggered the stand-off, with some observers blaming Anil's political ambitions, others the heavy investment by Mukesh and Reliance in a mobile phone venture. Shares of IPC dipped on the news in Mumbai, but recovered to trade almost 6% higher. Reliance shares added 1.7%, while Reliance Energy, headed by Anil, jumped 7%.\\n\",\n",

Jet Airways and Air Sahara are the two companies that will benefit initially. India is looking to develop its airline industry as booming economic growth drives demand for travel.\\n \\n Monica Chadha, BBC Delhi reporter, said air travel in India had increased by almost 20% from the previous year and was expected to rise even further. Infrastructure development is lagging demand, however, and will have to improve. \"Most international airports in the country are shabby and ill-equipped to handle heavy air traffic,\" Ms Chada said, adding that while the Civil Aviation minister has promised to modernise and privatise airports little progress has been made. Steps have been take to move things forward and the government recently changed legislation that limited foreign investment in domestic airlines. It raised the maximum stake holding allowed to 49% from 40%. Local press, meanwhile, have reported that the US and India will start negotiations about adding more routes in January.

However crude prices have rebounded in Asia, rising to $42.30 a barrel for February delivery. In London, trading of Brent crude was suspended for a public holiday, but the price fell to $39.20 in the Far East.\\n \\n With milder temperatures expected to continue in the northern parts of the US over the next few days at least, analysts have said the price of oil may fall further - even if the decline was only temporary. \"Weather has been the Achilles\\' heel of this market,\" said ABN AMRO analyst John Brady. \"But it is winter in the northeast. Eventually we\\'ll get another cold blast.\" Despite a fall of more than $12 a barrel from the record highs reached in late October, the price of crude oil remains almost 30% higher than year-ago levels. Prices rose last week after militant attacks in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, briefly renewed fears that the supply chain might be broken in the world\\'s leading crude exporter. \"The market was panicked but fears essentially evaporated... since there was no follow-up,\" said Deborah White, senior economist for energy at SG Securities in Paris.\\n',\n",

Under new European age discrimination rules, a default retirement age of 65 will be introduced. Workers will be permitted to request staying on beyond this compulsory retirement age, although employers will have the right to refuse. Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said people would not be forced to work longer than they wanted, saying the default age was not a statutory, compulsory retirement age. She said employers would be free to continue employing people for as long as they were competent.\\n \\n Under age discrimination proposals from the Department of Trade and Industry last year workers were to be allowed to work on till 70 if they wished.\\n \\n Business leaders had opposed the plan as they said it would be too costly and cumbersome. The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the latest proposal. \"This move today is the best of both worlds,\" it said. \"Employers have the ability to define the end point of the employer-employee relationship and employees have flexibility with a right to request to work past the age of 65.\" But Age Concern said imposing a retirement age of 65 was \"cowardly\" and a \"complete u-turn\". \"This makes a mockery of the Government\\'s so-called commitment to outlawing ageism, leaving the incoming age discrimination law to unravel,\" said Gordon Lishman, director general of Age Concern England . \"It is now inevitable that older people will mount legal challenges to the decision using European law.\" The decision will have no impact on the age at which workers can collect their state pension, the government has said.\\n',\n",

The clear signal pushed the dollar up to $1.3270 to the euro by 0400 GMT on Wednesday, but depressed US shares. \"The markets are starting to fear a more aggressive Fed in 2005,\" said Richard Yamarone of Argus Research. The Dow Jones index dropped almost 100 points on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq also falling as key tech stocks were hit by broker downgrades. The dollar also gained ground against sterling on Tuesday, reaching $1.8832 to the pound before slipping slightly on Wednesday morning.\\n \\n The release of the minutes just three weeks after the 14 December meeting was much faster than usual, indicating the Fed wants to keep markets more apprised of its thinking. This, too, is being taken in some quarters as a sign of aggressive moves on interest rates to come. The key Fed funds rate has risen 1.25 percentage points during 2004 from the 46-year low of 1% reached not long after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. That long trough \"might be contributing to signs of potentially excessive risk-taking in financial markets\", said the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC), which sets interest rates. The odds now favour a further boost to rates at the next meeting in early February, economists said. But the respite for the dollar, which spent late 2003 being pushed lower against other major currencies by worries about massive US trade and budget deficits, may be short-lived. \"You can\\'t rule out a further correction... but we don\\'t think it\\'s a change in direction in the dollar,\" said Jason Daw at Merrill Lynch. \"Nothing fundamental has changed.\"\\n',\n",

The High Street retailer said it now expected to report annual profits of between Â£415m and Â£425m ($779m-798m). Next\\'s shares fell more than 3% following the release of the trading statement.\\n \\n Next chief executive Simon Wolfson admitted that festive sales were \"below where we would expect a normal Christmas to be\", but said sales should still top analyst expectations.\\n \\n Among areas where Next could have done better, Mr Wolfson said menswear ranges were \"a little bit too similar to the previous year\". Mr Wolfson also said that disappointing pre-Christmas sales were \"more to do with the fact that we went in with too much stock rather than (the fact that) demand wasn\\'t there for the stock\". Next\\'s like-for-like store sales in the five months from 3 August to 24 December were up 2.9% on a year earlier. This figure is for existing Next stores, which were unaffected by new Next store openings. Like-for-like sales growth at the 49 Next stores directly affected by new store openings in their locality was 0.5%.\\n \\n Overall sales across both its retail and mail order divisions were up 12.4%, Next said. Its Next Directory mail order division saw sales rise 13.4% during the five-month period. \"In terms of all the worries about their trading pre-Christmas, it\\'s a result,\" said Nick Bubb, an analyst at Evolution Securities. \"Profits of around Â£420m would be well within the comfort zone.\" However, one dealer, who asked not to be named, told Reuters the seasonal sales performance was \"not what people had hoped for\". \"Christmas has been tough for the whole sector, and this is one of the best retailers,\" he said.

Krispy Kreme said accounting errors had forced the move, adding that its board of directors made the decision to restate its accounts on 28 December. However, the company was unavailable to comment on why it had delayed the news.\\n \\n It also warned it might have to further restate results for 2004 and 2005.\\n \\n Shares in Krispy Kreme sank 14.87% - or $1.83 - to close at $10.48 on the news. The revelation comes just a month after the firm warned earnings would be cut by as much as 7.6% as a result of accounting errors. Krispy Kreme said the latest adjustments involved the way it accounted for the repurchase of three franchise restaurants. It added it would now be reviewing how it accounts for its leases. In a further blow, the firm said it had been advised that some of its franchise owners were not in compliance with their loan agreements, and warned it might need to borrow extra money if it was required to honour agreements on franchisee debts or operating leases.\\n \\n Krispy Kreme added that it had enough cash to fund its current operations, but it could not borrow any more under its existing agreements. \"There are many more questions than answers, especially given increased concerns regarding company liquidity,\" JP Morgan Securities analyst John Ivankoe said in a research note on the firm. The announcement is the latest blow for the one-time darling of Wall Street, which has lost 80% of its stock value in just over a year.

Allowing for changes in calculating statistics, the average number of people out of work was the highest since 1990 - or a rate of 10.8%. Bad weather and a sluggish economy were blamed for the rise. The increase \"was due primarily to the onstart of winter\", labour office chief Frank-Juergen Weise said.\\n \\n Unadjusted, the figures showed unemployment rose 206,900 to 4.64 million - with many sectors such as construction laying off workers amid bad weather. \"The three years of stagnation in the German economy came to an end in 2004. But the upturn is still not strong enough\" to boost the labour market, Mr Weise added. News of the rise came as government welfare reforms came into force, a move that is expected to see unemployment swell still further in coming months. Under the Hartz IV changes, the previous two tier system of benefits and support for the long term unemployed has been replaced with one flat-rate payout. In turn, that means more people will be classified as looking for work, driving official figures higher.\\n \\n \"Be prepared for a nasty figure for January 2005, about five million unemployed on a non-seasonally adjusted basis,\" warned HVB Group economist Andreas Rees. But he did add that the numbers should \"subside\" throughout the year, to remain near 2004\\'s level of 4.4 million jobless. \"I don\\'t expect a strong and lasting turnaround until 2006,\" German Economy minister Wolfgang Clement said. By 2010, however, the Hartz IV reforms should help cut the average jobless rate to between 3% and 5%, he added. Europe\\'s biggest economy has been too weak to create work as it struggles to shake off three years of economic stagnation. In recent months companies such as Adam Opel - the German arm of US carmaker General Motors - and retailer KarstadtQuelle have slashed jobs.\\n',\n",

A further 40,000 farms are yet to be inspected, the state\\'s National Land Institute has told Associated Press. Vice president Jose Vicente Rangel has said farmers and ranchers with their titles in order and their lands productive have \"nothing to fear.\" Critics of the land reform policy claim president Hugo Chavez is trying to enforce a communist-style economic programme that ignores property rights and will damage the country. Land owners claim the National Land Institute has made mistakes in classifying lands as public or private.\\n \\n But the government - Venezuela\\'s largest land owner - say they are proceeding cautiously to prevent conflicts. In a statement, Mr Rangel said the land reform is not against the constitution, which permits private property, while stressing the efforts are to \"vindicate social and economically\" years of inequality in the country.\\n \\n One property in conflict with the government is the El Charcote cattle ranch, run by Agroflora, a subsidiary of the UK food group Vestey. Agriculture minister Arnoldo Marquez told Reuters news agency the site\\'s documents \"do not guarantee that this is a private land\". Administrators of the ranch, however, have complained that pro-Chavez squatters have taken over 80% of the property in the last four years, and the UK government has asked Venezuelan authorities to resolve the conflict. \"You should ask the company when they are going to put their papers in order and hand over the land that is not theirs,\" said Mr Marquez.\\n',\n",

The move is seen as evidence of a new commitment by the government to reduce the size of public sector. The official said the government has not yet decided whether the sale will take the form of a public flotation. \"The most important thing to decide now is the method - whether by selling shares to the public or to a strategic investor from abroad,\" he said.\\n \\n Analysts say the public-sector banks have suited the government\\'s monetary, credit and exchange policies. Nevertheless, the Egyptian government has spoken for years about privatising one of the big four state banks - Banque Misr, National Bank of Egypt, Banque du Caire and Bank of Alexandria. It had been expected one of the smallest of the four big public banks - Bank of Alexandria or Banque du Caire - would be sold first. The announcement reinforces the hopes of investors and international financial bodies for a revival of Egypt\\'s privatisation programme. About 190 state-run companies and facilities were sold off from the early 1990s to 1997. The appointment of Mahmoud Mohieldin, a reform-minded technocrat, to the new post of investment minister in July was taken as a sign that more sell-offs were on the way.

Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the US, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, Yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm Rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted.\\n \\n Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated US bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means. The company wants damages of $20bn, claiming Yuganskneftegas was sold at less than market value. Judge Letitia Clark will hear different motions, including one from Deutsche Bank to throw out the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The German lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned company that was expected to win the auction for Yuganskneftegas.

In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: \"There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made.\" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange.\\n \\n According to the FT, in its latest meeting Deutsche Boerse will adopt a charm offensive to woo the London exchange. The newspaper said the German suitor will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of London and let Ms Furse take the helm. Other reports this week said the Deutsche Boerse might even consider selling its Luxembourg-based Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions.

They are usually called corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, sustainability reports, or social and environmental reports.\\n \\n Peter Knight, director of Context, says 24 UK top 250 companies reported for the first time this year and, in general, the quality of reports has improved. \"The corporate lexicon of homilies, generalities and soft assurances - fluff - is on its way out. There are less pictures of smiling children and butterflies.\" The UK government will soon require all quoted companies to report their social and environmental risks in a chapter in their annual reports, called the Operating and Financial Review. The regulation is not expected until 2005 and the first reports under this scheme will not be published before 2006. The US seems to lag Europe in producing corporate social responsibility reports. The majority of European top 50 companies (44) publish them and only 27 of the US top 50.\\n',\n",
       " 'Tsunami to cost Sri Lanka $1.3bn\\n \\n Sri Lanka faces a $1.3bn (Â£691m) bill in 2005 for reconstruction after the tsunami which killed more than 30,000 of its people, its central bank says.\\n \\n This estimate is preliminary, bank governor Sunil Mendis told reporters, and could rise in 2006. The island state is asking for about $320m from the International Monetary Fund to help pay for relief, he said. The bank has 5bn rupees ($50m; Â£27m) set aside to lend at a lower interest rate to those who lost property. According to Mr Mendis, half the IMF support could come from a freeze on debt repayments, which would free up resources immediately. The rest could come from a five-year emergency loan. Sri Lanka is hoping for a wider freeze from other creditors.\\n \\n The Paris Club of 19 creditors meets on 12 January to discuss a debt moratorium for the nations hit by the tsunami, which ravaged south and east Asia on 26 December.\\n \\n Some 150,000 people across the region are feared to be dead and millions have been left homeless and destitute. A full reckoning of the economic cost to Sri Lanka of the tsunami will not be clear for some time to come. But already it looks likely that growth in the first half of 2005 will slow, Mr Mendis told reporters, although he would not say by how much. One side-effect of the disaster has been that the value of the rupee has risen as foreign funds have flooded into the country. The currency has strengthened 4% since late December, coming close to 100 rupees to the US dollar for the first time in more than six months.\\n',\n",
       " 'Indian oil firm eyes Yukos assets\\n \\n India\\'s biggest oil exploration firm, Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos.\\n \\n \"We are in touch with the concerned Russian entities about the Yukos assets and other opportunities in Russia,\" said ONGC chairman Subir Raha. Local press had reported that ONGC was looking to buy 15% of Yukos\\' former key oil production unit for $2bn (Â£1bn). Yukos is being broken up by Russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill.\\n \\n It was forced to sell its key production unit Yuganskneftegas (Yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $27bn in unpaid taxes and fines.\\n \\n State-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk and Russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. Indian oil minister Mani Shankar Aiyar discussed ONGC\\'s plans during a trip to Moscow last year, and the topic came up again during Russian president Vladimir Putin\\'s recent visit to New Delhi. \"It would make great sense for us to build on that,\" said Mr Aiyar. India\\'s oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. At the same time, India\\'s economy is booming and the country\\'s thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.\\n \\n India produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. Consumption, meanwhile, has jumped to 2.4 million bpd, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.\\n \\n \"For countries to develop, they have to have access to energy,\" said John Westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. India is a \"dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil\". By buying into Yugansk, ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf states for oil imports, Mr Westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India are slim. \"We forecast that Indian production will go into significant decline,\" Mr Westwood said. \"By 2020, production may only be at half of today\\'s levels.\" ONGC, which is majority-owned by the Indian state, already has bought petroleum assets in countries including Vietnam, Sudan and Russia. The company is a partner with Rosneft in the Sakhalin-1 oil field off Russia\\'s Siberian coast.\\n \\n ONGC is, however, not the only firm interested in Yugansk.\\n \\n Chinese crude company China National Petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor, while on Thursday, Italy refused to rule out an interest. ONGC\\'s interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world\\'s biggest oil producers brought to its knees. The dispute is partly driven by President Putin\\'s clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. Analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without Yugansk. On Thursday, a US court said it will hear arguments for Yukos\\' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 February. Should that happen, Yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets, analysts said.\\n',\n",

In addition to the penalty, Monsanto also agreed to three years\\' close monitoring of its business practices by the American authorities. It said it accepted full responsibility for what it called improper activities.\\n \\n A former senior manager at Monsanto directed an Indonesian consulting firm to give a $50,000 bribe to a high-level official in Indonesia\\'s environment ministry in 2002. The manager told the company to disguise an invoice for the bribe as \"consulting fees\".\\n \\n Monsanto was facing stiff opposition from activists and farmers who were campaigning against its plans to introduce genetically-modified cotton in Indonesia. Despite the bribe, the official did not authorise the waiving of the environmental study requirement. Monsanto also has admitted to paying bribes to a number of other high-ranking officials between 1997 and 2002.\\n \\n The chemicals-and-crops firm said it became aware of irregularities at a Jakarta-based subsidiary in 2001 and launched an internal investigation before informing the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Monsanto faced both criminal and civil charges from the Department of Justice and the SEC. \"Companies cannot bribe their way into favourable treatment by foreign officials,\" said Christopher Wray, assistant US attorney general. Monsanto has agreed to pay $1m to the Department of Justice, adopt internal compliance measures, and co-operate with continuing civil and criminal investigations. It is also paying $500,000 to the SEC to settle the bribe charge and other related violations. Monsanto said it accepted full responsibility for its employees\\' actions, adding that it had taken \"remedial actions to address the activities in Indonesia\" and had been \"fully co-operative\" throughout the investigative process.\\n',\n",
       " 'Marsh executive in guilty plea\\n \\n An executive at US insurance firm Marsh & McLennan has pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with an ongoing fraud and bid-rigging probe.\\n \\n New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer said senior vice president Robert Stearns had pleaded guilty to scheming to defraud. The offence carries a sentence of 16 months to four years in state prison. Mr Spitzer\\'s office added Mr Stearns had also agreed to testify in future cases during the industry inquiry. \"We are saddened by the development,\" Marsh said in a statement. The company added it would continue to co-operate in the case, adding it was \"committed to resolving the company\\'s legal issues and to serving our clients with the highest standards of transparency and ethics\".\\n \\n According to a statement from Mr Spitzer\\'s office, the Marsh executive admitted he instructed insurance companies to submit non-competitive bids for insurance business between 2002 and 2004. Those bids were then \"conveyed to Marsh clients under false and fraudulent pretences\". Through the practice, Marsh was allowed to determine which insurers won business from clients, and so control the insurance market, Mr Spitzer\\'s office added. It also protected incumbent insurers when their business was up for renewal and helped Marsh to maximise its fees, a statement said. In one case, an email showed Mr Stearns had instructed a colleague to solicit a non-competitive - or \"B\" - quote from AIG that was \"higher in premium and more restrictive in coverage\" and so fixed the bids in a way that would support the present provider Chubb. The company is also still being examined by US stock market regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Late last month the SEC asked for information about transactions involving holders of 5% or more of the firm\\'s shares.\\n',\n",

The move comes as a recovery in the US economy, the world\\'s biggest, shows signs of robustness and sustainability. The dollar\\'s record-breaking decline, meanwhile, has spooked markets and along with high oil prices has raised concerns about the pace of inflation. \"We are seeing evidence that inflation is moving higher,\" said Ken Kim, an analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research. \"It\\'s not a risk, it\\'s actually happening.\" Mr Kim added that borrowing costs could rise further.\\n \\n The Fed has said that it will move in a \"measured\" way to combat price growth and lift interest rates from their 40-year lows that were prompted by sluggish US and global growth.\\n \\n With the economic picture now looking more rosy, the Fed has implemented quarter percentage point rises in June, August, September and November. Although the US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9% in the three months to September, analysts warn that Fed has to be careful not to move too aggressively and take the wind out of the recovery\\'s sails. Earlier this month figures showed that job creation is still weak, while consumer confidence is subdued. \"I think the Fed feels it has a fair amount of flexibility,\" said David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae. \"While inflation has moved up, it hasn\\'t moved up a lot.\" \"If economic growth should subside... the Fed would feel it has the flexibility to pause in its tightening. \"But if economic growth picked up and caused core inflation to rise a little more quickly, I think the Fed would be prepared to tighten more quickly as well.\"\\n',\n",

The remaining $36m will be paid by the directors\\' insurers. But, a spokesman for the prosecutor, New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi, said no formal agreement had been made.\\n \\n Corporate governance experts said that if the directors do dip into their own pockets for the settlement, it will set a new standard for the accountability of bosses, when the firms they oversee face problems.\\n \\n \"Directors very rarely pay,\" said Charles Elson, chairman of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. He added that the settlement \"sends a pretty strong shockwave through the director world\". A formal agreement on the payout is expected to be signed on Thursday in a US district court in Manhattan. Earlier, the New York Times had reported that the personal payments were required as part of any deal at the start of negotiations. The ten former outside directors are James Allen, Judith Areen, Carl Aycock, Max Bobbitt, Clifford Alexander, Stiles Kellett, Gordon Macklin, John Porter, Lawrence Tucker and the estate of John Sidgmore, who died last year. It has not yet been determined how much each director will have to pay. \"None of the 10 former directors was a direct participant in the accounting machinations of the WorldCom fraud,\" said the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).\\n \\n Two other outside former directors, Bert Roberts and Francesco Galesi, remain defendants in the lawsuit, said the newspaper. According to the WSJ, which cites people familiar to the case, the settling directors are expected to deny wrongdoing and state they are settling the case to eliminate the uncertainties and expense of further litigations. The second-largest US long-distance telecoms operator filed for bankruptcy in 2002 when an $11bn accounting scandal was unearthed. The company emerged from Chapter 11 protection last year and changed its name to MCI Inc. Former WorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers is to face trial this month on criminal charges that he oversaw the fraud.\\n',\n",

Continental also said that, if it did not make any cuts, it expects to lose \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" in 2005 in current market conditions. Failure to make cutbacks may also push it to reduce its fleet, the group said. Shares in the fifth biggest US carrier had fallen 6.87% on the news to $10.44 by 1830 GMT. \"Without the reduction in wage and benefit costs and a reasonable prospect of future profitability, we believe that our ability to raise additional money through financings would be uncertain,\" Continental said in its filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\\n \\n Airlines have faced tough conditions in recent years, amid terrorism fears since the 11 September World Trade Centre attack in 2001. But despite passengers returning to the skies, record-high fuel costs and fare wars prompted by competition from low cost carriers have taken their toll. Houston-based Continental now has debt and pension payments of nearly $984m which it must pay off this year. The company has been working to streamline its operations - and has managed to save $1.1bn in costs without cutting jobs. Two weeks\\' ago the group also announced it would be able to shave a further $48m a year from its costs with changes to wage and benefits for most of its US-based management and clerical staff.\\n',\n",
       " 'House prices rebound says Halifax\\n \\n UK house prices increased by 1.1% in December, the first monthly rise since September, the Halifax has said.\\n \\n The UK\\'s biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1% over the whole of 2004, but by only 2.8% in the second half of the year. The average price of a house in the UK now stands at Â£162,086, Halifax said. The survey seems to fly in the face of recent evidence that the UK housing market has been slowing substantially in response to interest rate rises.\\n \\n Last week, the Nationwide said that house prices fell 0.2% in December, with annual inflation running at a three year low.\\n \\n On Tuesday, figures from the Bank of England showed that the number of mortgages approved in the UK has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade. New loans in November fell to 77,000, from 85,000 in October, the lowest rate since September 1995, the Bank of England said. Growth in unsecured lending, such as personal loans and credit cards, also slowed last month. Capital Economics, which has in the past predicted a sharp fall in UK house prices, branded Halifax\\'s findings a \"temporary surprise,\" which would be reversed over the coming months. \"The month by month volatility of the Halifax house price data should not distract from the fact that there is a clear downward trend in house prices,\" a Capital Economics statement said.\\n \\n Experts believe five interest rate rises since November 2003 are cutting borrowers\\' appetite for debt.\\n \\n Despite recording a price rise in December, the Halifax survey concluded that there was \"continuing signs of a genuine slowdown in the housing market.\" Martin Ellis, Halifax chief economist, said that there was no need to revise the bank\\'s prediction, made last month, that prices would fall by 2% in 2005. \"Sound housing market fundamentals will continue to underpin the market in 2005, ensuring that the market remains healthy and that house prices fall only slightly,\" Mr Ellis said. If the bank\\'s prediction of a 2% price drop comes true, it will be the first annual fall in nine years.\\n \\n The bank said that the recent pattern of house prices rising the fastest in the north of England continued in December. In the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber, Halifax said prices rose by 3% and 1.2% in the two regions respectively during the month. At the other send of the scale, prices in the South East and London fell by 1.6% and 0.5% respectively. The biggest decline was seen in Wales where prices fell by 6.2%, an area that had experienced strong house price growth during most of 2004. Overall, Halifax said prices in the final quarter of 2004 were 0.1% higher than in the previous quarter. This was the smallest quarterly rise since the second quarter of 2000, the bank said. As a result, annual house price inflation dipped below 20% during the final few months of 2004.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mixed Christmas for US retailers\\n \\n US retailers posted mixed results for December - with luxury retailers faring well while many others were forced to slash prices to lift sales.\\n \\n Upscale department store Nordstrom said same store sales were 9.3% higher than during the same period last year. Trendy youth labels also sold well, with sales jumping 28% at young women\\'s clothing retailer Bebe Stores and 32.2% at American Eagle Outfitters. But Wal-Mart only saw its sales rise after it cut prices. The company saw a 3% rise in December sales, less than the 4.3% rise seen a year earlier.\\n \\n Customers at the world\\'s biggest retailer are generally seen to be the most vulnerable to America\\'s economic woes.\\n \\n Commentators claim many have cut back on spending amid uncertainty over job security, while low and middle-income Americans have reined in spending in the face of higher gasoline prices. Analysts said Wal-Mart faced a \"stand-off\" with shoppers, stepping up its discounts as the festive season wore on, as consumers waited longer to get the best bargains. However, experts added that if prices had not been cut across the sector, Christmas sales - which account for nearly 23% of annual retail sales - would have been far worse. \"So far, we are faring better than expected, but the results are still split,\" Ken Perkins, an analyst at research firm RetailMetrics LLC, told Associated Press. \"Stores that have been struggling over the last couple of months appear to be continuing that trend. And for stores that have been doing well over the last several months, December was a good month.\" Overall, December sales are forecast to rise by 4.5% to $220bn - less than the 5.1% increase seen a year earlier.\\n \\n One discount retailer to fare well in December was Costco Wholesale, which continued a recent run of upbeat results with a better-than-expected 8% jump in same store sales. However, the losers were many and varied. Home furnishings store Pier 1 Imports saw its same store sales sink by a larger-than-forecast 8.8% as it battled fierce competition. Leading electronics chain Best Buy, meanwhile, missed its sales target of a 3-5% rise in sales, turning in a 2.5% increase over the Christmas period. Accessory vendor Claire\\'s Stores also suffered as an expected last minute shopping rush never materialised, leaving its same store sales 5% higher, compared to a 6% rise last year. Jeweller Zale also felt little Christmas cheer with December sales down 0.7% on the same month last year. \"This was not a good period for retailers or shoppers. We saw a dearth of exciting, new items,\" Kurt Barnard, president of industry forecaster Retail Consulting Group, said. However, one beneficiary of the desertion of the High Street is expected to be online stores. According to a survey by Goldman Sachs & Co, Harris Interactive and Neilsen/Net Ratings sales surged 25% over the holiday season to $23.2bn.\\n',\n",

But Air Deccan\\'s managing director Gorur Gopinath has said the price agreed was less than the catalogue price of $17.6m (Â£9.49m) per plane. Recently, India\\'s first low-cost airline ordered 30 Airbus A320 planes for $1.8bn.\\n \\n Under the agreement, Air Deccan will buy 15 new ATR 72-500 and lease another 15. ATR will also provide six second hand airplanes. In a statement, ATR has said deliveries of the aircraft will begin in 2005 and will continue over a five-year period.\\n \\n Mr Gopinath said the planes will connect regional Indian cities. \"After an evaluation of both ATR and Bombardier aircraft, we have chosen the ATR aircraft as we find it most suitable for our operations and for the Indian market for short haul routes.\" Filippo Bagnato, ATR\\'s chief executive, has said that his firm will also work with Air Deccan to create a training centre in Bangalore.\\n \\n The potential of the Indian budget market has attracted attention from businesses at home and abroad. Air Deccan has said it will base its business model on European firms such as Ireland\\'s Ryanair.

       " 'South African car demand surges\\n \\n Car manufacturers with plants in South Africa, including BMW, General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen, have seen a surge in demand during 2004.\\n \\n New vehicle sales jumped 22% to 449,603 from a year earlier, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA) said. Strong economic growth and low interest rates have driven demand, and analysts expect the trend to continue. NAAMSA said it expects sales to top 500,000 in 2005. During 2004 \"South Africa was one of the best performing markets internationally\" for car sales, NAAMSA said. While domestic demand is set to continue to enjoy rapid growth, foreign sales could come under pressure, analysts said. The vehicle industry accounts for about 13% of South Africa\\'s total exports. However, the world auto market has its problems and analysts warn that overcapacity and the strength of the rand could hit exports.\\n',\n",
       " 'UK bank seals South Korean deal\\n \\n UK-based bank Standard Chartered said it would spend $3.3bn (Â£1.8bn) to buy one of South Korea\\'s main retail banks.\\n \\n Standard Chartered said acquiring Korea First Bank (KFB) fulfilled a strategic objective of building a bigger presence in Asia\\'s third largest economy. Its shares fell nearly 3% in London as the bank raised funds for the deal by selling new stocks worth Â£1bn ($1.8bn), equal to 10% of its share capital. Standard Chartered expects about 16% of future group revenue to come from KFB.\\n \\n The South Korean bank will also make up 22% of the group\\'s total assets. The move, a year after Citigroup beat Standard Chartered to buy Koram bank, would be the South Korean financial sector\\'s biggest foreign takeover. This time around, Standard Chartered is thought to have beaten HSBC to the deal. KFB is South Korea\\'s seventh largest bank, with 3 million retail customers, 6% of the country\\'s banking market and an extensive branch network.\\n \\n The country\\'s banking market is three times the size of Hong Kong\\'s with annual revenues of $44bn. Standard Chartered has its headquarters in London but does two thirds of its business in Asia, and much of the rest in Africa. \"We\\'re comfortable with the price paid...the key here has been speed and decisiveness in making sure that we won,\" said Standard Chartered chief executive Mervyn Davies at a London press conference. Standard Chartered said KFB was a \"well-managed, conservatively run bank with a highly skilled workforce\" and represented a \"significant acquisition in a growth market\". In London, Standard Chartered\\'s sale of 118 million new shares to institutional investors pushed its share price down, and contributing to the FTSE 100\\'s 0.3% decline. Standard Chartered\\'s shares were 28 pence lower at 925p by midday. Some analysts also queried whether Standard Chartered had overpaid for KFB. The deal, which requires regulatory approval, is expected to be completed by April 2005 and to be earnings accretive in 2006, Standard Chartered said.\\n \\n Rival banking giant HSBC, which is based in London and Hong Kong, was also in the running. Standard Chartered is believed to have gained the initiative by putting together a bid during the Christmas break. \"They were able to move so quickly it caught HSBC by surprise,\" the Financial Times newspaper quoted an insider in the talks as saying. HSBC will now have to wait for the next South Korean bank in line to be sold off - thought likely to be Korea Exchange Bank, also currently in the hands of a US group. Standard Chartered said it was buying 100% of KFB, an agreement that would bring an end to the bank\\'s complex dual ownership. The South Korean government owns 51.4% of KFB, while the remaining shareholding, and operational control, are in the hands of US private equity group Newbridge Capital. Newbridge bought its stake during the government\\'s nationalisation of several banks in the wake of the 1997 Asia-wide currency crisis which crippled South Korea\\'s financial institutions.\\n \\n South Korea\\'s economy is expected to grow by 4.5% this year. Although often thought of an export-driven economy, South Korea\\'s service sector has overtaken manufacturing in the last decade or so. Services now make up roughly 40% of the economy, and consumer spending and retail banking have become increasingly important. In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, the government encouraged the growth of consumer credit. Bad loan problems followed; LG Card, the country\\'s biggest credit card provider, has been struggling to avoid bankruptcy for months, for instance. But analysts believe South Korea\\'s financial services industry is still in its infancy, offering plenty of scope for new products. Standard Chartered sees \"the opportunity to create value by the introduction of more sophisticated banking products\". Since 1999, KFB has been restructured from a wholesale bank into a retail bank focused on mortgage lending, which makes up 45% of its loans.\\n',\n",

A switch to new models hit luxury marque Mercedes-Benz, with sales down 3.1% at 1.06 million. Chrysler avoided the fate of US rivals Ford and General Motors, both of whom lost ground to Japanese firms. Its sales rose 3.5% to 2.7 million units.\\n \\n Similarly on the up was the Smart brand of compact cars, with the division\\'s sales jumping by 21.1% during 2004 to 136,000. The future of the brand - which is controlled by the Mercedes group within DaimlerChrysler - remains in question, however. Smart has consistently lost money since it started trading in 1998, and new model launches are now \"on hold\", said Mercedes chief executive Eckhard Cordes. In Europe, the Smart will now go on sale through regular Mercedes dealerships as well as its own dealer network, Mr Cordes said.\\n',\n",

By Monday\\'s close, the Jakarta Stock Exchange was down 2.1% at 1,011.15. Bar a slight dip at the New Year, The JSE had risen steadily by 4.7% since the tsunami hit on 26 December. Construction and property companies in particular have gained ground, although banks were among the main fallers on Monday.\\n \\n So far, more than 100,000 people are believed to have been killed in Indonesia, the country closest to the earthquake which triggered the great wave.\\n \\n On Friday, the government said its five-year estimate of rebuilding costs for Banda Aceh province - much of which was flattened by the quake and the tsunami - was 20 trillion rupiah ($2.2bn; Â£1.1bn), twice what it had previously estimated. That cost could be defrayed by temporary debt relief. On Monday, Indonesian economy minister Aburizal Bakrie told reporters that the Paris Club group of creditor countries was expected to freeze 20-30bn rupiah in payments due in 2005 and 2006. \"We hope we can resume the repayments at least from 2007,\" Mr Bakrie said. French finance minister Herve Gaymard said on Sunday that the Paris Club had already agreed to a moratorium on repayments for tsunami-hit countries ahead of its meeting on 12 January.\\n',\n",
       " 'Iran budget seeks state sell-offs\\n \\n Iran\\'s president, Mohammad Khatami, has unveiled a budget designed to expand public spending by 30% but loosen the Islamic republic\\'s dependence on oil.\\n \\n The budget for the fiscal year starting on 21 March calls for the sell-off of 20% of the state\\'s corporate holdings. Mr Khatami\\'s second term as president ends on 1 August, making this his last budget. But opposition from members of parliament who have attacked previous privatisations could block his plans. Elections in May 2004 ousted many of Mr Khatami\\'s supporters in parliament in favour of more hard-line religious conservatives. Late last year, they backed a law which would give parliament a veto over foreign investment. The ruling was a response to the involvement in telecoms and airport projects by Turkish companies, which hardliners accused of doing business with Israel. It came not long after the Expediency Council - Iran\\'s ultimate decision-maker - blessed Mr Khatami\\'s policy of selling stakes in sectors protected by the constitution such as energy, transport, telecoms and banking. Continued obstruction of foreign investment could get in the way not only of privatisation plans, but also of Mr Khatami\\'s hope of modestly reducing the government\\'s reliance on oil revenues.\\n \\n In an address to the Majlis, Mr Khatami predicted economic growth of 7.1% in 2005-6, up from 6.7% in the current year. He said he wanted to increase the 2005-6 budget to 1,546 trillion rials ($175.6bn; Â£93.6bn) from the previous year\\'s 1,070 trillion. Within that figure, taxation would rise to $14.3bn, a rise of over 40% from what is expected from the current year. In contrast, oil revenues were expected to fall to $14.1bn from $16bn in the year to March 2005. \"Current government expenditure should come from tax revenues,\" Mr Khatami said. \"Oil revenues should be used for productive investment.\" Mr Khatami has already been blocked by parliament from reducing the subsidies on many products including bread and petrol, reducing his room to manoeuvre.\\n',\n",

But, the EC did warn the two were under close scrutiny and it would act if their fiscal situations deteriorated. Under EU rules, member countries must keep their deficits below 3%. France and Germany will breach that this year. It will be the third year in a row that the two countries have broken the European Union\\'s Stability and Growth Pact rules.\\n \\n The eurozone\\'s two biggest economies left the pact in tatters in November 2003 when they persuaded fellow EU members to put the threat of penalties for deficit breaches on hold.\\n \\n The commission then took the pair to the European Court of Human Justice - which ruled EU countries could not put the pact \"in abeyance\", and confirmed the EC\\'s right to launch \"excessive debt procedures\". After announcing its decision to erase France and Germany from its list of deficit rule breakers, the EU said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that 2005 should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget\\'s below 3%. \"The commission concludes that the two countries appear to be on track to correct their excessive deficits by 2005,\" it said in a statement. The EU expects the German deficit to fall to fall to 2.9% of GDP next year from 3.9% this year, while France\\'s is forecast to drop to 3% from an expected 3.7% this year. The forecasts are based on EC predictions of GDP growth of 1.5% in Germany next year and 2.2% in France.\\n \\n Berlin welcomed the decision, with finance minister Hans Eichel saying it showed that the EC recognised Germany\\'s fiscal policy was \"on the right track even amid very difficult economic conditions\". However Paris was more subdued, with finance minister Herve Gaymard telling parliament: \"We must continue along this path of saving money.\" However, the move still had its critics, with the European People\\'s Party (EPP) attacking the EC for backing down from punitive action. \"The Commission is buckling under the pressure from Germany and France, \" EPP spokesman Alexander Radwan said. \"The scary fact is that budget sinners, despite having repeatedly exceeded the 3% deficit limit, do not have to fear any sanctions.\" Despite the commission delivering its decision on the two biggest eurozone economies, it refused to comment on similar action against Greece which has also broken the 3% deficit ceiling. Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said that it was a matter for next week.\\n',\n",
       " 'Enron bosses in $168m payout\\n \\n Eighteen former Enron directors have agreed a $168m (Â£89m) settlement deal in a shareholder lawsuit over the collapse of the energy firm.\\n \\n Leading plaintiff, the University of California, announced the news, adding that 10 of the former directors will pay $13m from their own pockets. The settlement will be put to the courts for approval next week. Enron went bankrupt in 2001 after it emerged it had hidden hundreds of millions of dollars in debt.\\n \\n Before its collapse, the firm was the seventh biggest public US company by revenue. Its demise sent shockwaves through financial markets and dented investor confidence in corporate America.\\n \\n \"The settlement is very significant in holding these outside directors at least partially personally responsible,\" William Lerach, the lawyer leading the class action suit against Enron, said. \"Hopefully, this will help send a message to corporate boardrooms of the importance of directors performing their legal duties,\" he added. Under the terms of the $168m settlement - $155m of which will be covered by insurance - none of the 18 former directors will admit any wrongdoing. The deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of Enron\\'s shareholders almost three years ago. So far, including the latest deal, just under $500m (Â£378.8m) has been retrieved for investors.\\n \\n However, the latest deal does not include former Enron chief executives Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling. Both men are facing criminal charges for their alleged misconduct in the run up to the firm\\'s collapse. Neither does it cover Andrew Fastow, who has pleaded guilty to taking part in an illegal conspiracy while he was chief financial officer at the group. Enron\\'s shareholders are still seeking damages from a long list of other big name defendants including the financial institutions JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston. The University of California said the trial in the case is scheduled to begin in October 2006. It joined the lawsuit in December 2001alleging \"massive insider trading\" and fraud, claiming it had lost $145m on its investments in the company.\\n',\n",
       " 'UK house prices dip in November\\n \\n UK house prices dipped slightly in November, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) has said.\\n \\n The average house price fell marginally to Â£180,226, from Â£180,444 in October. Recent evidence has suggested that the UK housing market is slowing after interest rate increases, and economists forecast a drop in prices during 2005. But while the monthly figures may hint at a cooling of the market, annual house price inflation is still strong, up 13.8% in the year to November. Economists, however, forecast that ODPM figures are likely to show a weakening in annual house price growth in coming months. \"Overall, the housing market activity is slowing down and that is backed up by the mortgage lending and the mortgage approvals data,\" said Mark Miller, at HBOS Treasury Services. \"The ODPM data is a fairly lagging indicator.\"\\n \\n The figures come after the Bank of England said the number of mortgages approved in the UK has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade. The Halifax, meanwhile, said last week that house prices increased by 1.1% in December - the first monthly rise since September.\\n \\n The UK\\'s biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1% over the whole of 2004, but by only 2.8% in the second half of the year. It is predicting a 2% fall in overall prices in 2005 as the market stabilises after large gains in recent years. The ODPM attributed the monthly fall of prices in November to a drop in the value of detached houses and flats. It said annual inflation rose between October and November because prices had fallen by 1.1% in the same period in 2003.\\n \\n The ODPM data showed the average house price was Â£192,713 in England; Â£139,544 in Wales; Â£116,542 in Scotland, and Â£111,314 in Northern Ireland.\\n \\n All areas saw a rise in annual house price inflation in November except for Northern Ireland and the West Midlands, where the rate was unchanged, the ODPM said. The North East showed the highest rate of inflation at 26.2%, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber on 21.7%, and the North West on 21.1%. The East Midlands, the West Midlands and the South West all had an annual inflation rate of more than 15%. In London, the area with the highest average house price at Â£262,825, annual inflation rose only slightly in November to 7.1% from 7% the previous month.\\n',\n",
       " 'Steady job growth continues in US\\n \\n The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world\\'s biggest economy.\\n \\n According to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004\\'s total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year\\'s main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\\n \\n \"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\\n \\n \"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it\\'s showing job growth, it\\'s a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\\n \\n Job creation was one of last year\\'s main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.\\n',\n",

Barclays has declined to comment on the report in the Sunday Express, saying it does not respond to market speculation. The two banks reportedly held talks in October and November 2004.\\n \\n Barclays shares were up 8 pence, or 1.3%, at 605 pence by late morning in London on Monday, making it the second biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 index. UK banking icon Barclays was founded more than 300 years ago; it has operations in over 60 countries and employs 76,200 staff worldwide. Its North American divisions focus on business banking, whereas Wells Fargo operates retail and business banking services from 6,000 branches. In 2003, Barclays reported a 20% rise in pre-tax profits to Â£3.8bn, and it has recently forecast similar gains in 2004, predicting that full year pre-tax profits would rise 18% to Â£4.5bn. Wells Fargo had net income of $6.2bn in its last financial year, a 9% increase on the previous year, and revenues of $28.4bn. Barclays was the focus of takeover speculation in August, when it was linked to Citigroup, though no bid has ever materialised.

Privately-held Falic Group bought two cosmetics brands, Hard Candy and Urban Decay, from LVMH in early 2003. The Florida company also own a chain of 90 duty free stores in the US.

In January 2004, Shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20% smaller than previously thought. Shell said the pay-off was in line with Ms Boynton\\'s contract. She was leaving \"by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities\", the firm said in a statement. The severance package means she keeps long-term share options, but fails to collect on a 2003 incentive plan since the firm has failed to meet the targets included in it.\\n \\n The revelation that Shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman, Sir Phil Watts, and production chief Walter van der Vijver.\\n \\n An investigation commissioned by Shell found that Ms Boynton had to share responsibility for the company\\'s behaviour. Despite receiving an email from Mr Van de Vijver which said the firm had \"fooled\" the market about its reserves, the investigation said, she did nothing to inquire further. In all, Shell restated its reserves four times during 2003. In September, it paid Â£82.7m in fines to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves.\\n',\n",

Ministers, eager to gain access to energy supplies to meet the demands of a booming economy, secured a similar deal to one between Iran and China. The announcement comes as ONGC said it was in talks to buy former assets of troubled Russian oil firm Yukos. The agreements with Iran were sealed after talks in New Delhi between Middle East producers and Asia's biggest energy consumers - China, India, Japan and South Korea.\\n \\n Iran - Opec's second-biggest oil producer and one of the world's top gas producers - has been pursuing a series of deals, rewarding LNG buyers with participation in development of its oil fields. Under the agreement, it will supply India with 7.5 million tonnes of LPG annually over a 25 year period from 2009. ONGC and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) reached a preliminary deal for Indian firms to take part in the development of the Yadavaran and Jufeyr oilfields, both countries said in a statement. India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption.

Both Deutsche Boerse and rival Euronext held talks with the London market last week over a possible offer. A Â£1.3bn offer from Deutsche Boerse has already been rejected, while Euronext has said it will make an all cash bid. Speculation suggests that Paris-based Euronext has the facilities in place to make a bid of Â£1.4bn, while its German rival may up its bid to the Â£1.5bn mark. Neither has yet tabled a formal bid, but the LSE is expected to hold further talks with the two parties later this week. However, the Sunday Telegraph report added that there are signs that Deutsche Boerse chief executive Werner Seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the LSE\\'s managed bid process.\\n \\n Despite insisting he wants to agree a recommended deal with the LSE\\'s board, the newspaper suggested he may pull out of the process and put an offer directly to shareholders instead. The newspaper also claimed Mr Seifert was becoming \"increasingly frustrated\" with the pace of negotiations since Deutsche Boerse\\'s Â£1.3bn offer was rejected in mid-December, in particular the LSE\\'s decision to suspend talks over the Christmas period. Meanwhile, the German exchange\\'s offer has come under fire recently. Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful. Others claim it will weaken the city\\'s status as Europe\\'s financial centre, while German politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator\\'s promise to move its headquarters to London if a bid is successful. A further stumbling block is Deutsche Boerse\\'s control over its Clearstream unit, the clearing house that processes securities transactions. LSE shareholders fear it would create a monopoly situation, weakening the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. LSE and Euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations, a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive.\\n',\n",

The move follows News Corp's decision to register its business in the US. 20th Century Fox's recent film releases include I Heart Huckabees and I, Robot, while Fox puts out hit TV series 24.\\n \\n Under the terms of the offer, minority Fox shareholders will receive 1.90 News Corp shares in return for each Fox share they hold. Analysts said the decision to list News Corp in the US - which will result in the firm's shares trading in New York rather than Sydney- nullified the need to retain a separate stock market listing for Fox Entertainment shares. News Corp investors voted in October to approve the transfer of the company's corporate domicile from Australia to the US state of Delaware. The move is designed to help News Corp attract more investment from the largest US financial institutions, and make it easier to raise capital. Fox Entertainment Group generated revenues of $12bn last year. News Corp shares fell 25 cents to $17.65 after the share offer was announced while Fox shares were up 19 cents at $31.22.\\n\",\n",

Airbus and Boeing accuse each other of benefiting from illegal subsidies. Mr Mandelson said the EU and US hoped to avoid having to resolve the dispute at the World Trade Organisation (WTO).\\n \\n \"With this agreement the EU and US have confirmed their willingness to resolve the dispute which has arisen between them,\" Mr Mandelson said. \"I hope our negotiations in the next three months will lead to an agreement ending subsidies to development and production of large civil aircraft.\" Last year, the US terminated an agreement with the EU, reached in 1992, which limits the subsidies countries can hand over to civil aircraft makers. The US filed a complaint against Brussels with the WTO over state aid to Airbus, prompting a retaliatory EU complaint over US support for Boeing. However, both sides agreed to suspend their requests for WTO arbitration at the beginning of December, to allow bilateral talks to continue. EADS and BAE Systems, the European defence and aerospace firms which own Airbus, welcomed Mr Mandelson\\'s announcement. \"It has always been preferable that any differences between the US and Europe on this matter be overcome through constructive discussion rather than through legal recourse,\" the companies said in a joint statement.\\n \\n Separately, the world\\'s largest package delivery company, UPS, said it had placed an order for 10 Airbus A380 superjumbo freight-carrying jets, with an option to buy 10 more of the triple-decker aircraft. The US company said it needed to expand its air freight capacity following strong international growth, and would begin receiving deliveries of the A380s from 2009. However, UPS said it was cutting a previous order for smaller Airbus A300s from 90 planes to 53. So far, Airbus has delivered 40 A300s to UPS.

Nortel shares, which have lost nearly 50% of their value since last year, climbed 1.46% in Toronto on Tuesday.

His comments follow the sale of much of oil giant Yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm\\'s assets into public ownership. On 28 December, another senior economic adviser called the sale \"the swindle of the century\". Yuganskneftegaz, the unit which produced 60% of Yukos\\' output, had been seized and sold in December for less than $10bn to a previously unknown firm called Baikal.\\n \\n Baikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm Rosneft, itself shortly to merge with state gas giant Gazprom. \"We used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing,\" Andrei Illarionov - then economic adviser to President Vladimir Putin - told a press conference. \"Now officials are doing it.\" Within days, he was stripped of most of his responsibilities.\\n \\n Mr Gref, a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market, was keen to distance himself from Mr Iliaronov\\'s comments. The privatisation of companies such as Yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled, he said. But he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil. \"I think that Rosneft and Yuganskneftegaz, should it become a state-owned company, must be privatized,\" he said.\\n \\n \"Today our government is ineffective and state companies, as a result, are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well.\" And he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like Yukos - a technique now being applied by the Kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake. \"If we follow that logic, we should nationalise all businesses,\" he said. Many large Russian companies, particularly in the energy sector, use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes.\\n \\n Mr Gref also poured cold water on President Putin\\'s promises of doubled economic growth within a decade. The assault on Yukos\\' assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months. \"The task is not simply to double GDP; instead it is to use GDP to qualitatively improve people\\'s lives,\" Mr Gref told Kommersant. \"We don\\'t need simply to increase GDP, but to improve its structure.\" Instead of focusing on headline growth figures, Russia needed to focus on better institutions, such as a more efficient - and less corrupt - court system.\\n',\n",
       " \"Chinese exports rise 25% in 2004\\n \\n Exports from China leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth.\\n \\n The spurt put China's trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high. It may also increase pressure on China to relax the peg joining its currency, the yuan, with the weakening dollar. The figures released by the Ministry of Commerce come as China's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row. State Administration of Taxation head Xie Xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; Â£165bn).\\n \\n According to the Ministry of Commerce, China's exports totalled $63.8bn in December, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. With imports rising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn. The increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004, according to Mr Xie. China's exporting success has made the trade deficit of the United States soar even further and made trade with China a sensitive political issue in Washington. The peg keeping the yuan around 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by US lawmakers for job losses at home. A US report issued on Tuesday on behalf of a Congressionally-mandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and 2003. The pace accelerated in the final three years of the period, said the report for the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, moving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors.

The KSE index closed at 6709.93 - an overall gain of nearly 400 points in the first two trading days of the week. Energy and telecommunication stocks performed particularly well, recording an 8%-10% rise since Monday morning.\\n \\n In 2002, the KSE was the world\\'s best performing stock market, with the index rising 112%.\\n \\n Pakistani investors are expecting the KSE to repeat, if not improve on, its 2002 performance. Jubilant investors danced on the streets as the market closed for the day on Tuesday, confident that the boom will continue at least until the public holiday on 22 January. Others, however, who had stayed out fearing an imminent collapse because of prices overheating, continued to warn that the \"bubble may burst any time\". \"That\\'s rubbish,\" KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani told the BBC News website. \"Whenever the market reflects Pakistan\\'s true economic reality, it is described as a bubble.\" Mr Lakhani feels that the market has risen on the basis of solid economic growth and its current level rests on sound foundations.\\n \\n Market analysts are inclined to agree with Mr Lakhani, arguing that there are a number of major factors behind the KSE\\'s performance. Analysts argue that a steady improvement in Pakistan\\'s credit ratings by international credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in the market. Standard & Poor\\'s upgraded Pakistan a few weeks ago. There are indications of yet another upgrade by the end of February.\\n \\n Then, say analysts, there is corporate profitability in the current fiscal year, which has gone up by 27% from last year. \"Coupled with the 7% GDP growth expected by June this year, I am least surprised at the market\\'s performance,\" says Mr Lakhani. One leading Karachi broker said the real reasons may be political. \"If you file a $1.3 trillion case against Saudi money after 9/11, Arab money will not go to the US any more.\" A lot of Arab money, he says, has already gone to Malaysia and Indonesia. Pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms, two of the strongest sectors in Pakistan, draw some of the Arab money to the KSE.\\n \\n Locally, too, say analysts, recent political developments have worked to the market\\'s advantage.\\n \\n An anti-Musharraf campaign threatened by the MMA, a countrywide alliance of religious parties, has fizzled out. The release of Asif Zardari, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto\\'s husband, has eased political tensions between the military-backed government and the opposition Pakistan People\\'s Party. Most importantly, say analysts, the failure of talks between India and Pakistan on the Baglihar dam in Indian-administered Kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions. This, they say, indicates that neither country is interested in raising the temperature at this stage, irrespective of the state of their disagreements. The market is abuzz with speculation that substantial investment may now start to flow in from the US, a country seen locally as deeply interested in defusing tensions between the South Asian neighbours. \"You can call it a peace dividend,\" smiles one broker. \"Let us see how long one can reap its benefits.\"\\n',\n",

That pushed the 10 month deficit to $500.5bn. Imports rose by 3.4%, while exports increased by only 0.6%. A weaker dollar also increased the cost of imports, though this should help drive export demand in coming months. \"Things are getting worse, but that\\'s to be expected,\" said David Wyss of Standard & Poor\\'s in New York. \"The first thing is that when the dollar goes down, it increases the price of imports. \"We are seeing improved export orders. Things seem to be going in the right direction.\"\\n \\n Despite this optimism, significant concerns remain as to how the US will fund its trade and budget deficits should they continue to widen. Another problem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with China, which has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order to boost exports. The US imported almost $20bn worth of goods from China during October, exporting a little under $3bn. \"It seems the key worry that has existed in the currency market still remains,\" said Anthony Crescenzi, a bond strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. The trade deficit and the shortfall with China \"are big issues going forward\". The Commerce Department figures caused the dollar to weaken further despite widespread expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a fifth time this year.

Several jurisdictions, notably the state of California, mandate low emissions for new cars. Equally, the rise in oil prices over the past year has sparked hopes that consumers may be tempted by potential savings of a few hundred dollars a year on fuel.\\n \\n At the Detroit Motor Show, a range of manufacturers are prominently displaying their hybrid credentials. Toyota has led the market to date with the Prius, popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish their \"green\" credentials. In April it will launch a hybrid version of its Highlander SUV, with an SUV from its luxury Lexus marque due later in the year.\\n \\n Honda has three hybrids on the market, and between them the two Japanese carmakers sold more than 80,000 units last year. Ford, which has sold 4,000 of its first hybrid since its launch in August, is bringing a hybrid SUV - the Mariner - to market a year ahead of schedule, with plans for three more models by 2008. GM has a hybrid pickup on the market and is showing two concept SUVs in Detroit. Even sports car maker Porsche may join the race, although it insists it is still considering whether to hybridise its Cayenne SUV.\\n \\n Others remain more sceptical. Nissan has bought Toyota\\'s hybrid technology, but plans to bring out its first model only in 2006. \"We want to make sure we are not concentrating on one technology,\" Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn said. \"We will not be surprised by any acceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market.\" Volkswagen, meanwhile, says it will focus on clean-burning diesel engines instead. And some watchers point out that the price tag on a hybrid - upwards of $3,000 above that of an equivalent normal-engined car, and suspicion of the technology - may still cool its attraction. \"The average consumers aren\\'t willing to pay that premium for a car they won\\'t drive more than six years,\" said Anthony Pratt from JD Power.\\n',\n",
       " \"Mitsubishi in Peugeot link talks\\n \\n Trouble-hit Mitsubishi Motors is in talks with French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen about a possible alliance.\\n \\n On Tuesday Mitsubishi, the only major Japanese car firm in the red, confirmed earlier reports of negotiations. But a spokesman refused to comment on speculation that Mitsubishi could end up building cars for PSA and perhaps its Japanese rival Nissan. Mitsubishi has been hit by a recall scandal and the withdrawal of support from shareholder DaimlerChrysler. The US-German firm, once a majority shareholder, decided last April to stop providing financial backing. Mitsubishi's sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. Mitsubishi is due to unveil a recovery plan later in January. Analysts said that alliances with other carmakers would be a necessary part of whatever it came up with, not least because its own slow sales have left its manufacturing capacity under-used.\\n\",\n",
       " 'BA to suspend two Saudi services\\n \\n British Airways is to halt its flights from London Heathrow to Jeddah and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia from 27 March.\\n \\n The airline said the decision was a commercial one due to reduced passenger demand for the services. BA currently operates four flights per week from Heathrow to Jeddah, and three weekly journeys to Riyadh. It suspended flights to Saudi Arabia for three weeks in autumn 2003 after a government warning about a \"threat to UK aviation interests in Saudi Arabia\".\\n \\n BA will now suspend the Saudi flights - which it says will remain \"under constant review\" - from 27 March. \"The decision to suspend flights between the UK and Saudi Arabia is a difficult one to make as we have enjoyed a long history of flying between the two countries,\" said BA director of commercial planning, Robert Boyle. \"However, the routes don\\'t currently make a profitable contribution to our business and we are unable to sustain them while this remains the case.\" Passengers with flights booked after the suspension date will be contacted by BA for alternative arrangements to be made.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cairn Energy in Indian gas find\\n \\n Shares in Cairn Energy rose 3.8% to 1,088 pence on Tuesday after the UK firm announced a fresh gas discovery in northern India.\\n \\n The firm, which last year made a number of other new finds in the Rajasthan area, said the latest discovery could lead to large gas volumes. However, chief executive Bill Gammell cautioned that additional evalution was first needed at the site. Cairn has also been granted approval to extend its Rajasthan exploration area. This approval has come from the Indian government.\\n \\n A spokesman said the company\\'s decision to carry out further investigations at the new find showed that it believed there was significant gas. But he added: \"It\\'s still too early to say what the extent of it is.\" Cairn\\'s string of finds in Rajasthan last year saw it elevated to the FTSE 100 index of the UK\\'s leading listed companies. The company had bought the rights to explore in the area from oil giant Shell. Mr Gammell is a former Scottish international rugby player.\\n',\n",
       " 'Asia quake increases poverty risk\\n \\n Nearly two million people across Asia could be thrown into poverty because of the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has said.\\n \\n In its first overview of the disaster, the ADB said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major cities and factories escaped damage. But the blow to many low-income people could be \"enormous\". The Paris Club of rich creditor nations on Wednesday offered to freeze debts owed by tsunami-hit countries.\\n \\n The move was aimed at helping South Asian governments find budgets to rebuild devastated coastal areas, though so far only Sri Lanka, Indonesia and the Seychelles have indicated that they will take it up.\\n \\n Other countries believe their economies are strong enough to cope or wish to avoid being viewed as credit risks. \"Poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster,\" said ADB chief economist Ifzal Ali. Donor nations have promised to give $717m (Â£379m) in disaster relief over the next six months, according to the United Nations.\\n \\n Mr Ali added his voice to those warning that aid pledges must be promptly delivered, saying the number of people at risk of poverty hinged on \"concerns over sanitation and health conditions, and other basic needs\" being \"properly and quickly addressed\".\\n \\n There are 1.9 billion people in Asia living on less than $2 a day. The ADB fears that 1 million Indonesians could join them, while in India just over half a million people - 645,000 - are at risk of falling into poverty. A quarter of a million Sri Lankans and 23,500 people in the Maldives are also facing poverty. In the Maldives, where 43% of the population already lives on less than $2 a day, this could rise to half. Sri Lanka and the Maldives are the two countries the ADB fears are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami. Sri Lanka\\'s government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly $3bn. A government task force held meetings to discuss an emergency rebuilding plan with the ADB, World Bank and Japanese aid agencies on Wednesday, and promised to publish the plan within 10 days.\\n \\n Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and India have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years, which should cushion them against reconstruction costs. Although Indonesia\\'s northern province of Aceh suffered the worst death toll, the region\\'s oil and natural gas production facilities \"have survived intact\", the report said. However, it remains too soon to asses the damage to poor people\\'s livelihoods in Aceh because it would depend on how much farm land had been flooded by seawater. \"This is a profoundly tragic event for the region and for the millions who are suffering. But the economies of the affected countries except Sri Lanka and the Maldives should emerge with minimal damage,\" the ADB report said. Some businesses may even gain from the reconstruction efforts, thereby creating jobs. At a meeting in Thailand, ABD president Thadao Chino said he was confident of the country\\'s \"own capabilities to restore normalcy to the affected areas and meet the rehabilitation requirements\". Thailand has said it does not wish to opt for a debt repayment freeze, while India has also rejected international aid, saying it can cope on its own resources. Debt repayment holidays carry the risk of credit ratings downgrades, making it more expensive to borrow money in future. Indonesia, however, is pressing for greater help with its debts than the current freeze would bring. It is one of the world\\'s most indebted countries.\\n',\n",
       " 'Fosters buys stake in winemaker\\n \\n Australian brewer Fosters has bought a large stake in Australian winemaker Southcorp, sparking rumours of a possible takeover.\\n \\n Fosters bought 18.8% of Southcorp, the global winemaker behind the Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount brands, for 4.17 Australian dollars per share. A bid at that price would value the company at A$3.1bn ($2.4bn; Â£1.25bn ). Fosters said it was currently in discussions \"which may lead to a major corporate announcement\".\\n \\n In a separate statement, Southcorp confirmed the brewer had asked for talks. Both firms asked the Sydney stock market to suspend trading in their shares until Monday. Southcorp\\'s shares were suspended at A$4.25.\\n \\n Fosters bought the 18.8% stake from Reline Investments, the family investment firm for the Oatleys, who founded the Rosemount Estates label and sold it to Southcorp in 2001. Robert Oatley and his son Sandy Oatley have both resigned from Southcorp\\'s board following the share deal. Southcorp employs 2,700 people and is the largest single investor in rural Australia, according to its website. The prospect of Fosters launching a major acquisition startled investors, as the brewer said last summer that it was not looking to expand through a big buy in the near future. It has cash available, after getting A$846m from selling property business Lensworth, but it has been widely expected to return cash to shareholders.\\n \\n \"People will scratching their heads over this one. Fosters has done a back-flip\", said Shawn Burns, a fund manger at Deutsche Asset Management. Southcorp\\'s shares have risen in recent months on speculation that it could become a takeover target. It spent two years in the red, returning to profit in 2004. Consolidation in the wine industry is being driven by Constellation, the world\\'s biggest winemaker. It seized the top spot when it bought Australian firm BRL Hardy for just over $1bn in 2003. Since then, it has paid $1bn for US wine maker Robert Mondavi, bought last month. Fosters\\' main wine business is Beringer Blass Wine Estate. Its best known brand is Fosters lager, though it makes a clutch of beer brands, and spirits. Analysts were divided on Thursday about whether Fosters was more likely to go for a takeover or merely wanted to take a big enough chunk of Southcorp to prevent it falling to a rival. \"Currently, I think the strategic position is more sensible rather than an outright takeover,\" said one analyst quoted by the Agence France Presse news agency. However, Matt Williams, a fund manager at Perpetual Trustees said taking the stake \"is definitely a precursor to a takeover\".\\n',\n",
       " 'ECB holds rates amid growth fears\\n \\n The European Central Bank has left its key interest rate unchanged at 2% for the 19th month in succession.\\n \\n Borrowing costs have remained on hold amid concerns about the strength of economic growth in the 12 nations sharing the euro, analysts said. Despite signs of pick-up, labour markets and consumer demand remain sluggish, while firms are eyeing cost cutting measures such as redundancies. High oil prices, meanwhile, have put upward pressure on the inflation rate.\\n \\n Surveys of economists have shown that the majority expect borrowing costs to stay at 2% in coming months, with an increase of a quarter of a percentage point predicted some time in the second half of the year. If anything, there may be greater calls for an interest rate cut, especially with the euro continuing to strengthen against the dollar. \"The euro land economy is still struggling with this recovery,\" said economist Dirk Schumacher. The ECB \"may sound rather hawkish but once the data allows them to cut again, they will.\" Data coming out of Germany on Thursday underlined the problems facing European policy makers. While Germany\\'s economy expanded by 1.7% in 2004, growth was driven by export sales and lost some of its momentum in the last three months of the year.\\n \\n The strength of the euro is threatening to dampen that foreign demand in 2005, and domestic consumption currently is not strong enough to take up the slack. Inflation in the eurozone, however, is estimated at about 2.3% in December, above ECB guidelines of 2%. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has remained upbeat about prospects for the region, and inflation is expected to drop below 2% later in 2005. The ECB has forecast economic growth in the eurozone of 1.9% in 2005.\\n',\n",
       " 'China bans new tobacco factories\\n \\n The world\\'s biggest tobacco consumer, China, has said it will not allow any new tobacco factories to be built.\\n \\n China already has more than enough cigarette-making capacity, according to a spokesman for the tobacco industry regulator quoted in China Daily. The ban threatens to reignite tensions between the regulator and British American Tobacco, which plans to become China\\'s first foreign cigarette maker. A spokeswoman for Bat declined to comment on the report.\\n \\n \"China won\\'t allow any new tobacco factories to be built, including joint ventures\", said Xing Wangli, a spokesman for the State Tobacco Administration Monopoly quoted in China Daily. He also said that the state would retain its monopoly on cigarette distribution. China has 350 million smokers who consumer 1.7 trillion cigarettes a year. Smoking is fashionable in China, where it is seen as an essential - and manly - sociable touch for some jobs, such as salesmen. More young, urban woman are taking up smoking too. In July 2004, Bat announced it had won approval for to build a $1.5bn (Â£800m) joint venture factory in China which would make it the first foreign cigarette maker to manufacture there.\\n \\n The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration said a week later that it had not approved the deal, leading to an embarrassing public row. Bat told the BBC at that time that it had not negotiated with the STMC, and secured approval from \"the highest levels of government\". Since then, the row has flared occasionally, most recently at a forum in November. Bat consistently declines to comment. \"Xing\\'s statement comes as especially bad news for British American Tobacco\", the China Daily newspaper said of the latest development. The Bat spokeswoman said: \"There is nothing for us to add...since our announcement in July last year. The central government of China is the authority that approved our strategic investment.\" The decision to ban further tobacco factories does not apply to deals made before 2005, according to the French news agency AFP. The joint venture factory was expected to take till 2006 to build. The Bat spokeswoman would not comment on its progress. However, if the STMA continues to take a tough stance, expansion opportunities could be limited.\\n \\n China\\'s tobacco market is increasingly valuable as anti-smoking campaigners target public smoking in the West. China Daily said the market was currently enjoying steady growth, making more than 210bn yuan ($25.4bn) in pre-tax profits last year, almost double the figure in 2000. The paper made no mention of health concerns. The STMA is trying to restructure the domestic tobacco industry, closing some factories, though such moves can be unpopular with local governments.\\n',\n",
       " 'UK interest rates held at 4.75%\\n \\n The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.\\n \\n Rates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August. Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.\\n \\n Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers\\' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain\\'s retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.\\n \\n \"Today\\'s no change decision is correct,\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"\\n \\n Mr Frost added: \"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"\\n \\n On Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists\\' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers\\' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers\\' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\\n \\n \"So far the evidence suggests that last year\\'s rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.\\n',\n",
       " 'German economy rebounds\\n \\n Germany\\'s economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.\\n \\n Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. It is the nineteenth month in a row that the ECB has not moved borrowing costs. Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.\\n \\n \"During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,\" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt. \"If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.\" Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. They have also warned there are more cost cutting measures on the horizon.\\n',\n",
       " 'US trade deficit widens sharply\\n \\n The gap between US exports and imports has widened to more than $60bn (Â£31.7bn), an all-time record.\\n \\n Figures from the Commerce Department for November showed exports down 2.3% to $95.6bn, while imports grew 1.3% to $155.8bn on rising consumer demand. Part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports. But the numbers suggested the sliding dollar - which makes exports less expensive - has had little impact, and could indicate slowing economic growth.\\n \\n The trade deficit - far bigger than the $54bn widely expected on Wall Street - prompted a rapid response from the currency markets.\\n \\n By 1650 GMT, the dollar was trading against the euro at $1.3280, almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement. Against the pound, the dollar was down about 0.7% at $1,8923. \"The dollar\\'s fall has been sudden, violent and appropriate given this number,\" said Brian Taylor of Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. \"Recent exchange rate movements certainly haven\\'t had any impact yet.\" Treasury Secretary John Snow put a brave face on the news, saying it was a sign of strong economic expansion. \"The economy is growing at such a fast rate that it is generating lots of disposable income... some of which is used to buy goods from our trading partners.\"\\n \\n Although the White House officially still backs the US\\'s traditional \"strong dollar\" policy, it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued. The dollar has fallen by 50% against the euro - as well as by 30% against the yen - in the past three years. The main catalyst, most economists accept, is the large budget deficit on the one hand, and the current account deficit - the difference between the flow of money in and out of the US - on the other. The trade deficit is a large part of the latter. In November, the fall in exports was largely due to a decline in sales of industrial supplies and materials such as chemicals, as well as of cars, consumer goods and food. One small bright spot for US policy-makers was a slight decline in the deficit with China, often blamed for job losses and other economic woes. Although China\\'s overall trade surplus is expanding, according to Chinese government figures, the Commerce Department revealed the US\\'s deficit with China was $19.6bn in November, down from $19.7bn the month before. But the deficit with Japan was at its worst in more than four years.\\n',\n",

Overall UK exports - including both goods and services - rose by more than 3.2% to Â£24.8bn, although total imports rose again to a new record of Â£27.9bn. The deficit for goods alone was Â£4.6bn, down from October\\'s Â£5bn. During November the UK exported Â£16.9bn worth of goods, but imported Â£21.5bn. The cumulative deficit for the first eleven months of 2004 now stands at Â£36.3bn, Â£4.5bn higher than the same period in 2003.\\n \\n November saw an improvement in export levels to both the European Union and the rest of the world, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. EU exports rose 2%, fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals. Non-EU exports shot up 7.5%, with growth seen across a range of manufacturing sectors including cars, consumer durables and chemicals. The export boost offset a 1% rise in imports. Non-EU imports rose 3%, but the growth in goods entering the UK from the EU slowed to 0.5%.\\n \\n The UK\\'s deficit with the EU fell to Â£1.9bn from Â£2.1bn, while its non-EU shortfall dropped to Â£2.7bn from Â£2.9bn in October.\\n \\n The country\\'s surplus on trade-in-services remained steady at Â£1.5bn for the fifth month in a row. Paul Dales, UK economist for Capital Economics, said the figures represented an improvement on recent months. However, he stressed that the long-term prognosis for exports was still uncertain. \"The figures are a lot better than expected but the trend still remains poor,\" he said. \"There have been some very encouraging signs that the UK export recovery is starting to take hold. But there is a danger that this could be held back by the ongoing weakness of domestic demand on the continent.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Lesotho textile workers lose jobs\\n \\n Six foreign-owned textile factories have closed in Lesotho, leaving 6,650 garment workers jobless, union officers told the AP news agency.\\n \\n Factory Workers Union secretary general Billy Macaefa blamed the closures on the end of worldwide textile quotas. The quotas for developing nations, ended on 1 January, gave them a set share of the rich countries\\' markets. They also limited the amount countries like China could export to the big markets of the United States and EU.\\n \\n \"We understand that some (owners)... were complaining that the South African rand was strong against the US dollar, and they were losing when exporting textiles and clothing to the United States,\" Mr Macaefa said at a news briefing in the capital, Maseru. Lesotho\\'s currency, the maloti, is fixed to the rand. \"But we suspect that they left the country unceremoniously because of the end of quotas introduced by the World Trade Organization.\" He said the six factories were Leisure Garments, Modern Garments, Precious Six Garments, TW Garments, Lesotho Hats and Vogue Landmark. The owners - two from Taiwan, two from China, one from Mauritius and one from Malaysia - left over the December holiday period without informing or paying their employees, he said.\\n \\n Union leaders and trade campaigners have been warning that developing nations such as Lesotho, Sri Lanka, and Bangaldesh could lose thousands of jobs once the quotas were lifted. In the mountainous country surrounded by South Africa, it is feared as many as 50,000 textile workers could lose their jobs, and Mr Mafeca said he expected more companies to leave. The assistance of a US law had given Lesotho\\'s textiles duty-free access to North American markets. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), gave sub-Saharan countries preferential access to the US market for apparel and textile products as well as a wide range of other goods.

Yuganskneftegaz pumps around 1 million barrels of oil a day. It was sold by the Russian authorities to recover government tax claims against Yukos totalling over $27bn. Previously considered to be Russia\\'s richest man, with an estimated fortune of $15bn, Mr Khodorkovsky is currently on trial for fraud and tax evasion following his arrest in October 2003. However, the charges are widely seen as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country\\'s super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs.

The three have refused to confirm reports they plan to launch a private airline in competition with Aer Lingus. They announced in November they would quit in May, but did not give a reason. That decision had followed an announcement by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern - who is still considering the future of the airline - which ruled out a proposed management buy-out of Aer Lingus. Mr Walsh denied they had been forced out early because of the reports claiming they were set to launch a competitor airline.\\n \\n \"What I do after I leave Aer Lingus is still too early to say,\" Mr Walsh told AP news agency on Wednesday. \"I have opportunities open to me. Brian and Seamus are in the equally fortunate position.\" He said he had received more than 40 business proposals, mostly aviation-related, since the trio announced their resignations two months ago. Mr Walsh said there was no conflict of interest, and, if he was to launch a rival airline or join an existing competitor, \"this thing happens in every business\". \"There\\'s absolutely no question of a conflict of interest. I\\'ve been completely focused on my responsibilities at Aer Lingus,\" he told AP.\\n \\n This week opposition politicians had called on the Irish government to make an urgent decision on the future of the airline. On Wednesday Irish Transport Minister Martin Cullen said in a statement: \"A conflict of interest cannot, should not and will not be allowed to arise between their current roles at Aer Lingus and their future career intentions.\" Last Friday the minister had announced he was to advertise for three senior executives for Aer Lingus. Mr Walsh, who took charge in 2000, and his team have earned praise for turning Aer Lingus around, by cutting air fares and staff, and re-positioning it as a low-fare airline to rival Ryanair.

New EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said on Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to reopen talks in the aircraft subsidies row, which led to tit-for-tat WTO filings in last autumn.\\n \\n Explaining why it has asked the WTO to set up a dispute settlement panel on customs barriers, the US Trade Representative\\'s Office said that it wants to tackle the issue \"early in the EU\\'s process of dealing with the problems of enlargement\". Ten countries, mostly in Eastern Europe, joined the EU in May. The US said its trade with the 25 EU member countries was worth $155.2bn (Â£82.8bn) in 2003. \"Although the EU is a customs union, there is no single EU customs administration,\" a statement issued on behalf of Robert Zoellick, US Trade Representative, said.

We \"would like to get into it\".\\n \\n The success of products such as Sony\\'s Playstation, Microsoft\\'s X-Box and Nintendo\\'s Game Cube have boosted demand for video games.\\n \\n The days of arcade classics such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man and Donkey Kong are long gone. Today, games often have budgets big enough for feature films and look to give gamers as real an experience as possible. And with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies, video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun. Mr Chernin, however, told the FT that News Corp was finding it difficult to identify a suitable target. \"We are struggling with the gap between companies like Electronic Arts, which comes with a high price tag, and the next tier of companies,\" he explained during a conference in Phoenix, Arizona. \"These may be too focused on one or two product lines.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'US Ahold suppliers face charges\\n \\n US prosecutors have charged nine food suppliers with helping Dutch retailer Ahold inflate earnings by more than $800m (Â£428m).\\n \\n The charges have been brought against individuals as well as companies, alleging they created false accounts. Ahold hit the headlines in February 2003 after it emerged that there were accounting irregularities at its US subsidiary Foodservice. Three former Ahold top executives last year agreed to settle fraud charges.\\n \\n Ahold has admitted that it fraudulently inflated promotional allowances at Foodservice, improperly consolidated joint ventures and also committed other accounting errors and irregularities.\\n \\n The nine now charged, who worked as suppliers to Ahold, are accused of signing false documents relating to the amount of money they paid the retailer for promoting their products in its stores. Food companies pay supermarkets and retailers for prime shelf space. The suppliers in question are said to have inflated the amount of money they paid, providing auditors with signed letters that allowed Ahold to inflate its earnings. US Attorney David Kelley said he expects the nine vendors will plead guilty to the charges. He added that there may be more court actions in the future. \"I don\\'t want to leave you with the impression that these were the only ones involved,\" he said. Among those facing charges are John Nettle, a former employee of General Mills; Mark Bailin of Rymer International Seafood; Tim Daly of Michael Foods and Kenneth Bowman, who worked as an independent contractor for Total Foods.\\n \\n Others include Michael Hannigan of Sugar Foods; Peter Marion of Maritime Seafood Processors and First Choice Foods; Gordon Redgate of Commodity Manager and Private Label Distribution; Bruce Robinson of Basic American Foods and Michael Rogers, formerly of Tyson Foods. Pasquale D\\'Amuro of the FBI called the nine vendors the key ingredients in \"the process of cooking the books\" at Ahold. At the time of the scandal, Ahold was seen by many as Europe\\'s Enron. Ahold shares tumbled on the news and many market observers predicted that the fall out could damage investor confidence across Europe. It was less severe than many had envisaged, however, and since then Ahold has worked hard at rebuilding its reputation and investor confidence. Ahold is the world\\'s fourth-largest supermarket chain. Its other US businesses include Stop & Shop, and Giant Food.\\n',\n",
       " 'Wal-Mart fights back at accusers\\n \\n Two big US names have launched advertising campaigns to \"set the record straight\" about their products and corporate behaviour.\\n \\n The world\\'s biggest retailer Wal-Mart took out more than 100 full page adverts in national newspapers. The group is trying to see off criticism over it pay deals, benefits package and promotion strategy. Meanwhile, drugs group Eli Lilly is planning a campaign against \"false\" claims about its product Prozac. Wal-Mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the Wall Street Journal, using an open letter from company president Lee Scott saying it was time for the public to hear the \"unfiltered truth\".\\n \\n \"There are lots of \\'urban legends\\' going around these days about Wal-Mart, but facts are facts. Wal-Mart is good for consumers, good for communities and good for the US economy,\" Mr Scott said in a separate statement.\\n \\n Its adverts - and a new website - outlined the group\\'s plans to create more than 10,000 US jobs in 2005. Wal-Mart\\'s average pay is almost twice the national minimum wage of $5.15 (Â£3.90) an hour, while employees are offered health and life insurance, company stock and a retirement plan, the adverts say. Unions accuse Wal-Mart of paying staff less than its rivals do, with fewer benefits. In California, the company is fighting opposition to new stores amid allegations it forces local competitors out of business. Lawmakers in the state are also examining allegations that the firm burdens the state with an unfair proportion of employee health care costs. \"I think they are going to have a tough time suddenly overcoming the perceptions of some people,\" said Larry Bevington, chairman of Save Our Community - a group fighting to prevent Wal-Mart opening a store in Rosemead, California. Wal-Mart is also fighting two lawsuits - one accusing it of discriminating against women and another alleging it discriminates against black employees.\\n \\n Meanwhile Eli Lilly is launching a series of adverts in a dozen major newspapers, to present what is says are the true facts about its anti-depressant drug Prozac.\\n \\n The move is in response to a British Medical Journal article that claimed \"missing\" Lilly documents linked Prozac to suicide and violent behaviour. In the averts, entitled An Open Letter from chief executive Sidney Taurel, the company says the article continues to \"needlessly spread fear among patients who take Prozac\". \"It was simply wrong to suggest that information on Prozac was missing, or that important research data on the benefits and possible side effects of the drug were not available to doctors and regulators,\" the letter added. Eli Lilly\\'s chief medical officer Alan Breier said that the article was \"false and misleading\" as the documents it referred to were actually created by officials at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and presented to an FDA meeting in 1991. Later, FDA medical advisors agreed the claims were based on faulty data and there was no increased risk of suicide.\\n',\n",
       " 'US retail sales surge in December\\n \\n US retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in December, boosted by strong car sales.\\n \\n Seasonally adjusted sales rose 1.2% in the month, compared to 0.1% a month earlier, boosted by a surge in shopping just before and after Christmas. Sales climbed 8% for the year, the best performance since an 8.5% rise in 1999, the Commerce Department added. The gains were led by a 4.3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out of showrooms. Dealers were forced to cut prices in December to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started.\\n \\n The increase in sales during December pushed total spending for the month to $349.4bn (Â£265.9bn). Sales for the year also broke through the $4 trillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4.06 trillion However, if automotives are excluded from December\\'s data, retail sales rose just 0.3% on the month. Home furnishings and furniture stores also performed well, rising 2.2%. But as well as hitting the shops, more US consumers were going online or using mail order for their purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%. However, analysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the Federal Reserve Bank off its current policy of measured interest rate rises. \"Consumers for now remain willing to spend freely, sustaining the US expansion. Given that attitude, the Fed remains likely to continue boosting the Fed funds rate at upcoming meetings,\" UBS economist Maury Harris told Reuters.\\n \\n Retail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the US. Consumer spending has been picking up in recent years after slumping during 2001 and 2002 as the country battled to recover from its first recession of the decade and the World Trade Centre attacks. During that time, sales grew a lacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later. Looking ahead, analysts now expect improvement in jobs growth to feed through to the High Street with consumer spending remaining strong. The belief comes despite the latest labor department report showing a surprise rise in unemployment. The number of Americans filing initial jobless claims jumped to 367,000, the highest rate since September. However, long-term claims slipped to their lowest level since 2001.\\n',\n",

The two companies held four days of talks after Foster\\'s bought an 18.8% stake in Southcorp on 13 January. A merger would create a global player with worldwide annual sales of 39m cases and revenues of A$2.6bn.\\n \\n Southcorp said Foster\\'s A$4.17-a-share takeover proposal offered a \"excellent strategic fit\" but undervalued the company. \"Southcorp\\'s board has informed Foster\\'s that it is not prepared to recommend the offer as it does not adequately reflect the strategic value of the company,\" said Southcorp chairman Brian Finn.\\n \\n Southcorp said Foster\\'s takeover offer was \"opportunistic\". However, it said that the offer may represent an \\'opening bid\\', opening up the possibility of Foster\\'s returning with an improved offer.\\n \\n Foster\\'s said a combination of the two companies would create a global player with an \"unrivalled\" collection of premium wine brands. Despite being best known for brewing Foster\\'s Lager, Foster\\'s is already one of Australia\\'s largest wine producers, owning the Beringer and Wolf Blass brands among others. \"The combination of Foster\\'s and Southcorp will transform the global wine industry and significantly enhance Australia\\'s competitive position on the global stage,\" said Trevor O\\'Hoy, Foster\\'s chief executive officer. Foster\\'s spent A$584m on buying an 18.8% stake in Southcorp from the Oatley family, which founded the Rosemount Estates business and later merged it into Southcorp. Shares in both companies were suspended while the two held talks about a deal. Southcorp\\'s shares rose 12% to A$4.76 on news of the offer but Foster\\'s shares fell 3.7% to A$5.44.\\n',\n",

He resigned in November to fight the illness. Joining the company as a 15-year-old part-time worker, Mr Bell quickly moved through its ranks, becoming Australia\\'s youngest store manager at 19. A popular go-getter, he is credited with helping revive McDonald\\'s sales. Mr Bell leaves a wife and daughter. \"As we mourn his passing, I ask you to keep Charlie\\'s family in your hearts and prayers,\" chief executive James Skinner said in a statement. \"And remember that in his abbreviated time on this earth, Charlie lived life to the fullest.\" \"No matter what cards life dealt, Charlie stayed centred on his love for his family and for McDonald\\'s.\"\\n \\n After running the company\\'s Australian business in the 1990s, Mr Bell moved to the US in 1999 to run operations in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In 2001, he took over the reins in Europe, McDonald\\'s second most important market. He became chief operating officer and president in 2002. Mr Bell took over as chief executive after his predecessor as CEO, Jim Cantalupo, died suddenly of a heart attack in April. Having worked closely with Mr Cantalupo, who came out of retirement to turn McDonald\\'s around, Mr Bell focused on boosting demand at existing restaurants rather than follow a policy of rapid expansion. He had promised not to let the company get \"fat, dumb and happy,\" and, according to Reuters, once told analysts that he would shove a fire hose down the throat of competitors if he saw them drowning. Mr Bell oversaw McDonald\\'s \"I\\'m lovin\\' it\" advertising campaign and introduced successes such as McCafe, now the biggest coffee shop brand in Australia and New Zealand. Colleagues said that Mr Bell was proud of his humble beginnings, helping out behind cash tills and clearing tables when visiting restaurants.\\n',\n",
       " 'US industrial output growth eases\\n \\n US industrial production continued to rise in November, albeit at a slower pace than the previous month.\\n \\n The US Federal Reserve said output from factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3% - in line with forecasts - from a revised 0.6% increase in October. Analysts added that if the carmaking sector - which saw production fall 0.5% - had been excluded the data would have been more impressive. The latest increase means industrial output has grown 4.2% in the past year. Many analysts were upbeat about the prospects for the US economy, with the increase in production coming on the heels of news of a recovery in retail sales. \"This is very consistent with an economy growing at 3.5 to 4.0%. It is congruent with job growth and consumer optimism,\" Comerica chief economist David Littman said of the figures.\\n \\n The US economy grew at a respectable annual rate of 3.7% in the three months between July and September, while jobs growth averaged 178,000 during the same period. While the employment figures are not spectacular, experts believe they are enough to whittle away at America\\'s 5.4% jobless rate. A breakdown of the latest production figures shows mining output drove the increase, surging 2.1%, while factory output rose 0.3%. But utility output dropped 1.4%. Meanwhile, the amount of factory capacity in use during the month rose to 77.6% - its highest level since May 2001. \"Many investors think that product market inflation won\\'t be a problem until the utilisation rates are at 80% or higher,\" Cary Leahy, senior US economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said. \"So there is still a lot of inflation-fighting slack in the manufacturing sector,\" \"Overall I\\'d say manufacturing at least away from autos continues to improve and I would bet that it improves at a faster rate in coming months given how lean inventories are,\" Citigroup senior economist Steven Wieting added.\\n',\n",

Opposition from TCI has fuelled speculation that the proposed takeover could fail. Rival exchange operator Euronext has also said it may bid for the LSE. Euronext operates the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon bourses, while Deutsche Boerse runs the Frankfurt exchange.\\n \\n BBC News spoke to a number of analysts on Monday morning about shareholder worries over Deutsche Boerse\\'s bid for LSE. Although none were prepared to speak on the record, most thought it was unlikely that TCI\\'s opposition would halt the deal\\n \\n \"Obviously we\\'ll have to wait and see, but I don\\'t think it will make much difference. Deutsche Boerse appears very committed,\" said one London-based broker. He forecast the takeover bid would succeed and was more concerned to see improvements in the daily running of the LSE. In voicing its opposition to the planned takeover, TCI said it would prefer to see Deutsche Boerse return $500m (Â£350m) to shareholders. The Deutsche Boerse was prepared to pay for the LSE \"exceeds the potential benefits of this acquisition\", said TCI.\\n \\n Another Deutsche Boerse shareholder on Monday also appeared to back TCI\\'s call. Another investor in Deutsche Boerse has supported the view that a payout to shareholders would be preferable to Deutsche Boerse overpaying for the LSE, Reuters news agency reported. \"We prefer a sensible entrepreneurial solution at a price that is not too high,\" said Rolf Dress, a spokesman for Union Investment. \"If that cannot be achieved, then we would wish for a distribution of liquid assets to shareholders.\" The Financial Times also reported a third Deutsche Boerse shareholder as opposed to the deal. It quoted a spokesman for US-based hedge fund Atticus Capital complaining that the planned takeover appeared to be motivated by \"empire-building\" rather than the best interests of shareholders.\\n \\n TCI has called for Deutsche Boerse to hold an emergency general meeting to discuss the bid for LSE. Yet under German business law, DB does not have to gain shareholder approval before making a significant acquisition. Deutsche Boerse said TCI\\'s opposition would not change its bid approach. \"Deutsche Boerse is convinced that its contemplated cash acquisition of the London Stock Exchange is in the best interests of its shareholders and the company,\" it said. DB\\'s shares were up 3.4% to 45.25 euros by 1030 GMT, the highest gainer in Frankfurt.\\n',\n",

Unions criticised the possible move - which may affect cabin and maintenance staff - saying Qantas was profitable. More than 90% of the airline\\'s staff are based in Australia.\\n \\n Qantas confirmed it was looking at whether it might recruit and source products overseas - potentially through joint ventures - but said it would continue to create jobs in Australia.\\n \\n Despite making a record Australian dollars 648m ($492m) profit last year, Qantas has argued that it needs to make considerable savings if it is to remain competitive. \"We\\'re going to have to get the lowest cost structure we can and that willmean sourcing things more and more from overseas,\" the newspaper quoted Qantas chief executive Geoff Dixon as saying. Early this year, Qantas increased the number of flight attendants based in London from 370 to 870. If Qantas were to follow the lead of other airlines moving staff \\'offshore\\' 7,000 jobs could shift overseas, the newspaper reported. In a statement, Qantas said it was looking to build its operations overseas. However, it stressed this would not result in large scale redundancies in its home market, where most of its 35,000 staff are employed. \"We are totally committed to continuing to grow jobs in Australia,\" Mr Dixon said. \"We are, however, operating in a global market and there is no room for complacency simply because we are currently profitable and successful.\"\\n \\n Unions reacted angrily to the reported disclosure, arguing that Qantas was profitable and did not need to take such action. \"We could understand if Qantas was a struggling airline about to go under,\" Michael Mijatov, international division secretary of the Flight Attendants Association, told Agence France Presse. \"Qantas announced a record profit last year and is on course this year for an even greater profit so it is totally unnecessary.\" In an effort to meet the challenge posed by low cost carriers, Qantas sought a tie-up with Air New Zealand last year However, the deal was thrown out by the New Zealand High Court on competition grounds.\\n',\n",

The paper added that most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company's export activity. Gazprom, the biggest gas company in the world, took over nuclear fuel giant Atomstroieksport in October 2004. The main project of Atomstroieksport is the building of a nuclear plant in Iran, which has been a source of tension between Russia and the US.\\n \\n Gazprom is one of the key players in the complex Russian energy market, where the government of Vladimir Putin has made moves to regain state influence over the sector. Gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm Rosneft, the company that eventually acquired Yuganskneftegas, the main unit of embattled oil giant Yukos. Claims for back-taxes was a tool used against Yukos, and led to the enforced sale Yuganskneftegas. Some analysts fear the Kremlin will continue to use these sort of moves to boost the efforts of the state to regain control over strategically important sectors such as oil.\\n\",\n",

Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms. Changes to the pact are due to be agreed at an economic summit in March.\\n \\n The current EU rules limit the size of a eurozone country\\'s deficit to 3% of GDP. Countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the European Commission, although several countries, including Germany, have breached the rules consistently since 2002 without facing punishment. The European Commission acknowledged last month that it would not impose sanctions on countries who break the rules.\\n \\n Mr Schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions. \"The stability pact will work better if intervention by European institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions,\" he wrote. \"Only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the EU.\"\\n \\n Deficits should be allowed to rise above 3%, Mr Schroeder argued, if countries meet several \"mandatory criteria\". These include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms, countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering \"special economic burdens\". The proposed changes would make it harder for the European Commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pact\\'s rules. Mr Schroeder\\'s intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 Eurozone finance ministers on Monday to discuss the pact. The issue will also be discussed at Tuesday\\'s Ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 EU members.

Deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, below Chancellor Gordon Brown\\'s forecast of 3% to 3.5%. It also believes that interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of the year.\\n \\n In its quarterly economic review, Deloitte said the UK economy had enjoyed a \"golden period\" during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s.\\n \\n But it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major \"imbalances\" in the economy. Deloitte\\'s chief economic advisor Roger Bootle said: \"The biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown. \"Whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.\"\\n \\n Economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, Deloitte believes. Gordon Brown will need to raise about $10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term, the firm claims. This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year, when the economy expanded by 3.25%. However, Deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the Bank of England to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering. It expects a series of \"aggressive\" interest rate cuts over the next two years, with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006. \"Although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong, it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the UK economy,\" Mr Bootle.\\n',\n",

The trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, making motorists reluctant to use them. Instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option. \"The price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable,\" said Wang Yan, an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development and Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper. Mr Wang, who is in charge of collecting car parking fees, said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap. Indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones.\\n \\n Sports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission\\'s road rage. It wants them to use public transport, and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds. Mr Wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches. Indoor parking may be costly, but it is not always secure. Mr Wang\\'s team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan ($48; Â£26). The Beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries\\' motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic.

The employment picture also improved, the Fed said.\\n \\n \"Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest,\" the Beige Book said. \"Several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.\" The report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. \"Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington DC, and New York City, two of the nation\\'s strongest commercial markets,\" the Fed said.\\n',\n",

EBay stock fell to $92.9 in after-hours trade, from a $103.05 end on Nasdaq. EBay\\'s net revenue for the quarter rose to $935.8m from $648.4m, boosted by growth at its PayPal payment service.\\n \\n Excluding special items, eBay\\'s profit was 33 cents a share, but analysts had expected 34 cents.\\n \\n \"I think Wall Street has gotten a bit ahead of eBay this quarter and for the 2005 year.\" said Janco Partners analyst Martin Pyykkonen. For 2004 as a whole, eBay earned $778.2m on sales of $3.27bn. EBay president and chief executive Meg Whitman called 2004 an \"outstanding success\" that generated \"tremendous momentum\" for 2005. \"I\\'m more confident than ever that the decisions and investments we\\'re making today will ensure a bright future for the company and our community of users around the world,\" she said. EBay now forecasts 2005 revenue of $4.2bn to $4.35bn and earnings excluding items of $1.48 to $1.52 per share. Analysts had previously estimated that eBay would achieve 2005 revenues of $4.37bn and earnings of $1.62 per share, excluding items.\\n',\n",

His indictment includes charges of securities fraud, conspiracy and filing false reports with regulators. If found guilty, Mr Ebbers could face a substantial jail sentence. He has firmly declared his innocence.\\n \\n Under Mr Ebbers' leadership, WorldCom emerged from Mississippi obscurity to become a $160bn telecoms giant and the darling of late 1990s investors. Yet as competition intensified and the telecoms boom petered out, WorldCom found itself under growing financial stress. When WorldCom finally collapsed, shareholders lost about $180bn and 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Mr Ebbers' trial, which is expected to last two months, is the latest in a series of attempts by US prosecutors to pursue senior executives for fraud. It will coincide with the retrial of former Tyco International chief Dennis Kozlowski and his top lieutenant, accused of looting the industrial conglomerate to the tune of $600m. Trail preparations are also preparing for former executives of shamed US energy firm Enron.\\n\",\n",
       " 'High fuel costs hit US airlines\\n \\n Two of the largest airlines in the US - American and Southwest - have blamed record fuel prices for their disappointing quarterly results.\\n \\n American Airlines\\' parent AMR reported a loss of $387m (Â£206m) for the fourth quarter of 2004, against a $111m loss for the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines saw its fourth-quarter 2004 profits fall 15% to $56m, against $66m a year earlier. Both said high fuel bills would continue to pressure revenues in 2005. American, the world\\'s biggest airline by some measures, said it expected to report a loss for the first quarter of 2005. Southwest, which has the highest market value of any US carrier, said it would remain profitable despite high fuel prices.\\n \\n AMR\\'s shares were flat in Wednesday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as the results were slightly better than analysts had anticipated. AMR\\'s chief executive Gerard Arpey said the airline\\'s difficulties reflected the situation within the industry. \"AMR\\'s results for the fourth quarter of 2004 reflect the economic woes that plagued the airline industry throughout 2004 - in particular, high fuel prices and a tough revenue environment,\" he said. For the full year, AMR posted a loss of $761m, lower than 2003\\'s $1.2bn loss and an indication that the airline has successfully cut costs. AMR added that as part of its cost cutting measures, it is postponing the delivery of 54 Boeing jets. Shares in Southwest fell 65 cents to $14.35 as analysts voiced their disappointment. \"The results came in below our already conservative estimate for the quarter,\" said Ray Neidl, an analyst at Calyon Securities. Both American and Southwest have been squeezed by cut-throat competition in the US airline industry, as a glut of available seats has led to fierce price reductions.\\n',\n",

GM\\'s revenues rose 4.7% to $51.2bn from $48.8bn a year earlier. The fourth-quarter losses at General Motors Europe totalled $345m, up from $66m during the same period in 2003. GM\\'s main European brands are Opel and Vauxhall.\\n \\n Excluding special items, GM\\'s global income from continuing operations totalled $569m during the quarter, down from $838m a year earlier. The results were in line with Wall Street expectations and shares in GM rose by about 1% in pre-market trade. For the whole of 2004, GM earned $3.7bn, down from $3.8bn in 2003, while its annual revenue rose 4.5% to $193bn. GM said its profits were also hit by higher healthcare costs in the US. \"GM reported solid overall results in 2004, despite challenging competitive conditions in many markets around the globe,\" GM chairman and chief executive Rick Wagoner said in a statement. The company recently announced that it expected profits in 2005 to be lower than in 2004.\\n',\n",
       " 'EU to probe Alitalia \\'state aid\\'\\n \\n The European Commission has officially launched an in-depth investigation into whether Italian airline Alitalia is receiving illegal state aid.\\n \\n Commission officials are to look at Rome\\'s provision of a 400m euro ($495m; Â£275m) loan to the carrier. Both the Italian government and Alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid. The investigation could take up to 18 months. However, Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot said he wanted it to be carried out as swiftly as possible. \"The Italian authorities have presented a serious industrial plan,\" said Mr Barot. \"We now have to verify certain aspects to confirm that this plan contains no state aid. I would like our analysis to be completed swiftly.\"\\n \\n The matter of possible state aid was brought to the Commission\\'s attention by eight of Alitalia\\'s rivals, including Germany\\'s Lufthansa, British Airways and Spain\\'s Iberia. While Alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability, the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition. Alitalia lost 330m euros in 2003 as it struggled to get to grips with high costs, spiralling oil prices, competition from budget carriers and reduced demand. It plans to split into AZ Fly and AZ Services, which will handle air and ground services respectively. Alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997. EU rules prevent that from happening again in what is known as the \"one time, last time\" rule for airlines. Otherwise, EU regulations on state aid stipulate that governments may help companies financially, but only on the same terms as a commercial investor. The airline declined to comment on the Commission decision.\\n',\n",

In return for the funding, Turkey would be expected to keep inflation under control and introduce market reforms. Turkey\\'s economy has steadily recovered from a severe crisis in 2001.\\n \\n Economic growth has average 6-7% in the past three years, ahead of IMF forecasts, while inflation fell below 10% this year for the first time in 30 years. However, Turkey has a huge debt burden - already owing $23bn to the IMF - while its current account deficit has swelled to $10.7bn this year.\\n \\n The Turkish economics minister, Ali Babacan, said the two sides had reached general agreement on a new three year funding program. Rodrigo de Rato, the IMF\\'s managing director, said the loan agreement would help to improve Turkish economic prospects by cutting its debt and stimulating growth. \"I believe the new programme, if implemented successfully, will help Turkey create the conditions for sustained growth and employment creation, reduce inflation toward European level and enhance the economy\\'s resilience,\" he said. The agreement must still be ratified by IMF directors at a meeting expected to take place next month.\\n \\n The agreement would also enable Turkey to defer payments on previous loans worth $3.7m until 2006.\\n \\n As part of the draft agreement, Turkey has signed a \"letter of intent\" stating its determination to push through far-reaching reforms to its tax and benefits system and its banking sector. Such reforms are considered vital for Turkey if it is to fulfil its ambition of joining the European Union. The EU will decide on 17 December whether to begin entry talks with Turkey. The US, the largest of the IMF\\'s 184 members, is a strong supporter of continued financial support for Turkey.\\n',\n",

       " 'Tsunami slows Sri Lanka\\'s growth\\n \\n Sri Lanka\\'s president has launched a reconstruction drive worth $3.5bn (Â£1.8bn) by appealing for peace and national unity.\\n \\n President Kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from Sri Lanka\\'s economic growth this year. It estimated the wave left physical damage equal to 6.5% of the economy.\\n \\n Separately, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in Sri Lanka and Indonesia alone. It called for action to create jobs. President Kumaratunga attended a ceremony in the southern town of Hambantota. She was joined by government and opposition politicians, together with Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Christian clergy.\\n \\n Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse laid the foundation stone on a new housing project intended to provide 6,000 homes for survivors of the tsunami. Mrs Kumaratunga called for the tragedy to be \"the start of a new beginning to rebuild our nation\". \"We are a country blessed with so many natural resources and we have not made use of them fully. Instead we have been squabbling, fighting,\" she added. Norway\\'s peace negotiator Erik Solheim is due to arrive on Wednesday to try to revive peace talks in the decades-long conflict between government forces and the Tamil Tigers, who want a separate state in the north east of the country. Reconstruction efforts in eastern Sri Lanka have been hampered by tensions between the two sides.\\n \\n The IMF said that the Sri Lankan authorities\\' initial estimates have put the physical damage at $1.3 to $1.5bn, but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this. \"The broader macroeconomic impact will clearly be substantial but the details are difficult to assess at this early stage,\" the IMF said. Growth, inflation, the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs. \"The fishing industry has been devastated, agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer, especially in the short term,\" the report said. The ILO estimated that 400,000 Sri Lankans have lost their jobs, mostly in these three industries. Earnings from tourism this year are expected to be 15% lower than last year. Economic growth this year is expected to be 4%, which is about 1% less than previously forecast. Inflation could climb to 14% compared to a previous estimate of 12%. Although major exports have not suffered, the IMF expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments. Foreign exchange reserves may become strained as \"Sri Lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre-tsunami level\" which totalled more than two months worth of imports. Last week, the IMF approved Sri Lanka\\'s request for a freeze on loan repayments.\\n',\n",
       " 'China suspends 26 power projects\\n \\n China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.\\n \\n The move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. \"Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,\" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency\\'s website.\\n \\n Some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government\\'s battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or \\'river of golden sand\\' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency\\'s list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.\\n \\n The Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China\\'s energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.\\n',\n",

The merger was announced in a statement on Standard Trust\\'s website on Tuesday, but no financial details were revealed. United Bank is the third biggest in Nigeria in terms of number of branches. Standard Trust is smaller but more profitable. \"The boards of United Bank and Standard Trust, at separate meetings yesterday, approved arrangements to merge both institutions,\" Standard Trust said. Standard Trust is 100% Nigerian-owned, but United Bank has some foreign investors, including New York-based Global Depository Receipts (32.8%), and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and Monte del Paschi di Siena, both from Italy, who each have a 2.4% stake.\\n',\n",

Virgin Blue reported a 22% fall in first quarter profits in August 2004 due to tough competition. In November, first half profits were down due to slack demand and rising fuel costs. Virgin Blue was launched four years ago and now has roughly one third of Australia\\'s domestic airline market. But the national carrier, Qantas, has fought back with its own budget airline, Jetstar, which took to the skies in May 2004.

Vivendi advisor Deutsche Bank was also the subject of a complaint filing. Deutsche Bank, which was responsible for selling the convertible bonds to investors, could face penalties if the complaint is upheld.\\n \\n Vivendi has said it believes there is \"no legal basis\" for the complaints. The watchdog is said to believe the executive pair were party to \"privileged information\" surrounding the issue of the bonds. Both men bought some of the bonds, the Associated Press news agency reported. AMF is investigating claims that the duo were aware of an interest in Vivendi\\'s US assets from investor Marvin Davis, at the time of the bond sale. Vivendi, however, has said that the information was public knowledge as Mr Davis\\' offer for the US assets had already been rejected by Vivendi\\'s board. AMF is also looking into whether the executives knew that Vivendi was considering exercising its right to buy British Telecom\\'s shares in Cegetel. Vivendi has rejected the charge, saying the decision to buy the Cegetel shares was \"no more than a possibility, of which the public was perfectly aware\" at the time of the bond issue. Back in December, Vivendi and its former chief executive Jean-Marie Messier were each fined 1m euros ($1.3m; Â£690,000) by AMF.

Demand for the insurer's debut shares was strong - 12 times what was on sale. The listing was part of the country's plans to open up its insurance market and boost demand in the sector. Deregulation is expected to boost demand for accident and damage cover.\\n \\n Previously, only NCCI has been legally allowed to offer insurance products within Saudi Arabia. However, the authorities have turned a blind eye to the many other firms selling insurance. Saudi Arabia now wants a fully functioning insurance industry and is introducing legislation that will clamp down on unauthorised companies. Policy-makers also want to make having insurance more of a requirement, but first have to take steps to boost public confidence in the system, analysts said. As a result, NCCI is being developed as the industry's flagship firm - publicly-listed, with audited accounts. Saudi Arabia sold 7 million NCCI shares, or about 70% of the company's total capital last month. More than 800,000 applicants got 9 shares each for 205 riyals apiece.\\n\",\n",

Products from these zones will enjoy duty free access to the US, provided that 35% of their components are the product of Israeli-Egyptian cooperation. The US describes this as the most important economic agreement between Egypt and Israel in two decades.\\n \\n The protocol establishing the zones has been stalled for years. There has been deep sensitivity in Egypt about any form of co-operation with Israel as long as its peace process with the Palestinians remains blocked. But in recent weeks an unusual warmth has crept into relations between the two countries. Both exchanged prisoners earlier this month, with Egypt handing back an Israeli who has served eight years in prison after being convicted for spying.\\n \\n Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has described Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as the best chance for the Palestinians to achieve peace.

The ONS revised the annual 2004 rate of growth down from the 5.9% estimated in November to 3.2%. A number of retailers have already reported poor figures for December. Clothing retailers and non-specialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth, according to the ONS.\\n \\n The last time retailers endured a tougher Christmas was 23 years previously, when sales plunged 1.7%.\\n \\n The ONS echoed an earlier caution from Bank of England governor Mervyn King not to read too much into the poor December figures. Some analysts put a positive gloss on the figures, pointing out that the non-seasonally-adjusted figures showed a performance comparable with 2003. The November-December jump last year was roughly comparable with recent averages, although some way below the serious booms seen in the 1990s. And figures for retail volume outperformed measures of actual spending, an indication that consumers are looking for bargains, and retailers are cutting their prices.\\n \\n However, reports from some High Street retailers highlight the weakness of the sector. Morrisons, Woolworths, House of Fraser, Marks & Spencer and Big Food all said that the festive period was disappointing.\\n \\n And a British Retail Consortium survey found that Christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years.

The WEF report shows that despite the fact that 14,000 people contract HIV/Aids every day, concern among businesses has dropped by 23% in the last 12 months. Most (71%) have no policies in place to address the disease. Nor could over 65% of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of HIV among their staff. The UN programme tackling Aids, UNAIDS, pointed out that having a clear strategy for dealing with HIV/Aids was a good investment as well as being socially responsible.\\n \\n One company that does have a plan is Anglo-American, the international mining company, which estimates an HIV prevalence of 24% among its 130,000-strong Southern African workforce.\\n \\n Over the last two years the company has implemented extensive voluntary counselling and testing for HIV infection, coupled with anti-retroviral therapy for employees progressing to Aids. Over 90% of the 2,200 employees who have accessed and remained on treatment are well and have returned to normal work. \"Effective action on HIV/Aids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations,\" said Brian Brink, senior vice-president, health, at Anglo-American.\\n \\n \"Companies should encourage all workers to know their HIV status, making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol,\" he said. \"Providing access to treatment is a critical part of this.\" Across sub-Saharan Africa, even in countries with an HIV prevalence of 10-19%, only around 7% of companies have formal HIV/Aids policies in place, according to the report. The gap is even wider in China, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Russia, the so-called \"next wave\" countries, which are predicted to experience the highest numbers of new HIV/Aids cases worldwide by 2010. The report adds \"an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the HIV/Aids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting,\" said David Bloom, professor of economics and demography at the Harvard School of Public Health.\\n \\n The WEF report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to HIV/Aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them. A key priority, in both high and low-prevalence settings, said the WEF is to establish a policy based on non-discrimination and confidentiality.\\n',\n",

Despite struggling since it was opened in 1992, EuroDisney has recently made progress in turning its business around and ticket sales have picked up. However, analysts still question whether it attracts enough visitors to stay open, even with the restructuring.\\n \\n EuroDisney remains Europe's largest single tourist attraction, attracting some 12.4 million visitors annually. A new attraction - Walt Disney Studios - has recently opened its site near Paris. The company's currently traded stock tumbled in Paris on the latest news, shedding 15% to 22 euro cents. EuroDisney will sell the new shares priced at 9 euros cents each. The US Disney Corporation and Saudi Arabian prince Al-Walid bin Talal, the firm's two main shareholders, will buy the new stock. The restructuring deal is the second in the firm's troubled financial history; its finances were first reorganised in 1994.\\n\",\n",

They use \"pester power\" to get their parents to stump up nearly a third of this income, the report said. As for how they spend their cash, the bulk goes on personal care, soft drinks and food, Datamonitor said.\\n \\n Datamonitor adds that British teenagers are keen on personal care because it helps them combine two seemingly contradictory emotional needs - the desire to fit in and the desire to express their individuality.\\n \\n British teenage girls, compared to their counterparts in seven European countries, are the most keen to use make-up products. Nearly three out of four girls said they used make-up. According to the Datamonitor report the trend marked British teenagers out as \"particularly important to cosmetics manufacturers as they are likely to experiment more with brands and products and form long-term beauty routines\". And the good times are likely to keep rolling for British children, as the report predicts that they will still be topping the earnings table in 2008.\\n',\n",

Shares in ACC fell 5.5% as investors, who thought the offer was underpriced, decided to sell. Meanwhile, UK-based firm Aggregate Industries said it had agreed a Â£1.8bn takeover by Holcim.\\n \\n The deal with Aggregates will give Holcim, the world\\'s second-biggest cement maker, an entry into the UK market and boost its presence in the US. Peter Tom, who will remain as Aggregate chief executive, said the 138p a share offer provided \"significant value\" for shareholders. The Markfield, Leicestershire-based company runs 142 quarries in the UK and the US. It also has 164 ready-mixed concrete plants, 90 asphalt plants and 32 pre-cast concrete factories.\\n \\n If the Indian deals go ahead, it will give Holcim a major presence in the world\\'s fastest-growing market behind China.

The move follows a decision earlier this month by Anil - the younger brother of Reliance Group president Mukesh Ambani - to resign from his post. His resignation was not accepted by his brother, who is also the boss of IPCL. The IPCL board met in Mumbai to discuss the company's results for the October-to-December quarter.\\n \\n It is understood that the board also considered Anil's resignation and asked him to reconsider his decision. However, Anil's demand that Anand Jain - another IPCL board member accused by Anil of creating a rift in the Ambani family - be thrown out, was not met. Anil has accused Anand Jain, a confidant of his brother Mukesh, of playing a negative role in the Ambani family, and being responsible for the trouble between the brothers. On Wednesday, the board of Reliance Energy, another Reliance Group company, reaffirmed its faith in Anil, who is the company's chief. Reliance Group acquired the government's 26% stake in IPCL - India's second-largest petrochemicals company - in 2002, as part of the privatisation drive. Meanwhile, the group's flagship company, Reliance Industries, has its board meeting on Friday to consider its financial results. Mukesh is the company's chairman and Anil its deputy, and it is expected that both brothers will come face to face in the meeting. The Ambani family controls 48% of the group, which is worth $17bn (Â£9.1bn; 745bn Indian rupees). It was founded by their father, Dhiru Bhai Ambani, who died two years ago.\\n\",\n",
       " 'World leaders gather to face uncertainty\\n \\n More than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the Swiss mountain resort Davos for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF). For five days, they will discuss issues ranging from China\\'s economic power to Iraq\\'s future after this Sunday\\'s elections. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and South African President Thabo Mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. Unlike previous years, protests against the WEF are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend.\\n \\n The Brazilian city of Porto Alegre will host the rival World Social Forum, timed to run in parallel with the WEF\\'s ritzier event in Davos.\\n \\n The organisers of the Brazilian gathering, which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes, have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the Swiss summit. However, many of the issues discussed in Porto Alegre are Davos talking points as well. \"Global warming\" features particularly high. WEF participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event. Davos itself is in deep frost. The snow is piled high across the mountain village, and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus 20C and less.\\n \\n Ultimately, the forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world\\'s 500 largest companies scheduled to attend.\\n \\n But much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to Davos, not least because the agenda of this year\\'s forum seems to lack an overarching theme. \"Taking responsibility for tough choices\" is this year\\'s official talking point, hinting at a welter of knotty problems. One thing seems sure, though: transatlantic disagreements over how to deal with Iran, Iraq and China are set to dominate discussions. Pointedly, only one senior official from President Bush\\'s new administration is scheduled to attend. The US government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise appearance in Davos.\\n \\n Ukraine\\'s new president, Viktor Yushchenko, is to speak, just days after his inauguration, an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power.\\n \\n The European Union\\'s top leaders, among them German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and European Commission President Manuel Barosso, will be here too. Mr Blair will formally open the proceedings, although his speech will be pre-empted by French President Jacques Chirac, who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured a slot for a \"special message\" two hours before Mr Blair speaks. The organisers also hope that the new Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three Israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event, a list that includes Shimon Peres. Davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between Yassir Arafat and Mr Peres came close to a peace deal. Mr Blair\\'s appearance will be keenly watched too, as political observers in the UK claim it is a calculated snub against political rival Chancellor Gordon Brown, who was supposed to lead the UK government delegation.\\n \\n Microsoft founder Bill Gates, the world\\'s richest man and a regular at Davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either. Having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against Aids and Malaria, Mr Gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases. On Tuesday, Mr Gates pledged $750m (Â£400m) of his own money to support the cause. Mr Gates\\' company, software giant Microsoft, also hopes to use Davos to shore up its defences against open source software like Linux, which threaten Microsoft\\'s near monopoly on computer desktops. Mr Gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with Brazil\\'s President Lula da Silva. The Brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from Microsoft to Linux.

       " 'US budget deficit to reach $368bn\\n \\n The US budget deficit is set to hit a worse-than-expected $368bn (Â£197bn) this year, officials said on Tuesday.\\n \\n The cost of military operations still needs to be factored in, with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further $100bn in the red. Past Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts said there would be a $348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year. In recent months, the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits. In November, the gap between US exports and imports widened to more than $60bn, a record figure. The CBO says it envisages a further \"orderly\" decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away. But the non-partisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost US economic growth.\\n \\n The budget deficit hit a record $412bn in the 12 months to 30 September 2004, after reaching $377bn in the previous fiscal year. The CBO also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015, an improvement on previous projections. However, analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential $2-$3.8 trillion costs of the president\\'s plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts. The figure could also be worsened by any further military costs. Republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the 11 September attacks and ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of President George W Bush\\'s election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years. But Democrats have accused the president of excluding Iraq-related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit, a charge which the administration denies. On Tuesday, the US administration asked Congress for additional funds for military operations.\\n',\n",

The move was widely criticised at the time, and now the German regulator has said it has found evidence of possible market manipulation. Citigroup said it would continue to co-operate fully with the authorities. \"We are disappointed that the BaFin has referred to the prosecutor the question of whether action should be brought against individuals involved,\" Citigroup said. If the traders are found guilty, they could face a five-year jail term or a fine, Reuters reported BaFin as saying. However, under German criminal law, prosecutors cannot pursue Citigroup itself.\\n \\n Germany\\'s financial watchdog BaFin told BBC News it had now transferred the investigation to the public prosecutor. \"I can confirm that BaFin has passed through the case to the public prosecutor,\" a BaFin spokeswoman said. \"It is now a criminal investigation.\" \"We found clues of possible market manipulation,\" the spokeswoman said, which included signs of linked bond trading ahead of the main trades on 2 August. \"Germany\\'s Securities Trading Act says that if BaFin finds such clues, it has to put the case in the hands of the prosecutor.\" Regulatory investigations are still going on in France, the UK and elsewhere. Some Citigroup operations elsewhere in the world came under regulatory criticism in 2004. Its private banking operation in Japan was closed down by regulators in Tokyo after an \"aggressive sales culture\" led the bank to flout anti-money laundering rules.\\n',\n",
       " 'Brazil jobless rate hits new low\\n \\n Brazil\\'s unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in three years in December, according to the government.\\n \\n The Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE) said it fell to 9.6% in December from 10.6% in November and 10.9% in December 2003. IBGE also said that average monthly salaries grew 1.9% in December 2004 from December 2003. However, average monthly wages fell 1.8% in December to 895.4 reais ($332; Â£179.3) from November. Tuesday\\'s figures represent the first time that the unemployment rate has fallen to a single digit since new measurement rules were introduced in 2001. The unemployment rate has been falling gradually since April 2004 when it reached a peak of 13.1%. The jobless rate average for the whole of 2004 was 11.5%, down from 12.3% in 2003, the IBGE said.\\n \\n This improvement can be attributed to the country\\'s strong economic growth, with the economy registering growth of 5.2% in 2004, the government said. The economy is expected to grow by about 4% this year. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva promised to reduce unemployment when he was elected two years ago. Nevertheless, some analysts say that unemployment could increase in the next months. \"The data is favourable, but a lot of jobs are temporary for the (Christmas) holiday season, so we may see slightly higher joblessness in January and February,\" Julio Hegedus, chief economist with Lopes Filho & Associates consultancy in Rio de Janeir, told Reuters news agency. Despite his leftist background, President Lula has pursued a surprisingly conservative economic policy, arguing that in order to meet its social promises, the government needs to first reach a sustained economic growth. The unemployment rate is measured in the six main metropolitan areas of Brazil (Sao Paolo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Recife, Salvador and Porto Alegre), where most of the population is concentrated.\\n',\n",
       " 'Indonesia \\'declines debt freeze\\'\\n \\n Indonesia no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the Paris Club group of creditors, Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie has reportedly said.\\n \\n Indonesia, which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer, owes the Paris Club about $48bn (Â£25.5bn). Mr Bakrie told the Bisnis Indonesia newspaper that a $1.7bn donors\\' aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary. This aid comes on top of a previously-pledged $3.4bn package. Most of this \\'normal aid\\' would be used to finance the country\\'s budget deficit. The Indonesian Economics Minister explained that the money - $1.2bn in grants and $500m in soft loans - was for the rebuilding of Aceh province, which was badly hit by the tsunami of 26 December. Nevertheless, one of Mr Bakrie\\'s deputies, Mahendra Siregar, told AFP news agency that Indonesia was still considering the offer by the Paris Club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments. \"What is true is that we are still discussing... the Paris Club decision to find out more details such as how much of our debt will be subject to a moratorium. That\\'s how far we are at this stage,\" said Mr Siregar.\\n \\n The 19 member countries of the Paris Club are owed about $5bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami. Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Seychelles accepted the Paris Club offer, which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little. Thailand and India have however declined the offer, with Thailand prefering to keep up with its payments while India said it would prefer to rely on its own resources rather than on international aid. Putting off payments may lower a country\\'s rating among financial organisations, making it more expensive and more difficult for them to borrow money in the future, analysts said. Separately, the Indonesian government has said it will announce monthly how much it has received in foreign donations and how it has spent the money. Welfare Minister Alwi Shihab told AP news agency that this announcement should allay suspicion of official corruption in relief operations.\\n',\n",
       " \"Parmalat bank barred from suing\\n \\n Bank of America has been banned from suing Parmalat, the food group which went bust in 2003 after an accounting scandal.\\n \\n The bank - along with investors, auditors and the group's managers - wants damages for being a victim of fraud at the hands of the Italian firm. But a judge has barred Bank of America and two auditors from the case. The bank, and Italaudit - formerly the Italian arm of auditor Grant Thornton - face lawsuits and possible prosecution. A second auditor, Deloitte & Touche, has also been banned from the case. Grant Thornton - now rid of the Italian unit at the centre of the case - is still being permitted to sue, as are Consob, Italy's stock market regulator, hundreds of small investors and Parmalat's new managers. Parmalat collapsed in December 2003 after it emerged that the 4bn euros ($5.2bn; Â£2.8bn) it supposedly held in a Bank of American offshore account did not in fact exist.\\n\",\n",
       " 'China continues rapid growth\\n \\n China\\'s economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003\\'s 9.1%.\\n \\n The news may mean more limits on investment and lending as Beijing tries to take the economy off the boil. China has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats. But officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus. Growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year.\\n \\n Still, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. The result could be higher interest rates. China raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in October 2004.\\n \\n Despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. \"There is no sign of a slowdown in 2005,\" said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings.\\n \\n China\\'s economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas. Figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004, up 35%. Part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan, China\\'s currency. The government keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the US dollar, - much to the chagrin of many US lawmakers who blame China for lost jobs and competitiveness. Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate. \"We need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time,\" National Bureau of Statistics chief Li Deshui told Reuters. \"Those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'SEC to rethink post-Enron rules\\n \\n The US stock market watchdog\\'s chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.\\n \\n In a speech at the London School of Economics, William Donaldson promised \"several initiatives\". European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly. The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\\n \\n The Act comes into force in mid-2005. It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.\\n \\n Firms that break the new law could face huge fines, while senior executives risk jail terms of up to 20 years. Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would \"continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements\". There are few, if any, who disagree with the intentions of the Act, which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts. But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.\\n \\n The 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy, a delisting. Mr Donaldson said the SEC would \"consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process\" for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements.\\n \\n \"We should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections\" without turning the US market into \"one with no exit\", he said. He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act\\'s least popular measure - Section 404 - for foreign firms. Seen as particularly costly to implement, Section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm\\'s internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (Â£374m).\\n \\n A delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change, the Financial Times reported.\\n \\n It was led by Digby Jones, director general of the UK\\'s Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and included representatives of BASF, Siemens and Cadbury Schweppes. Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings. Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (Â£558m) stock market debut last month. There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year. Instead, the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in Hong Kong, according to press reports in China.\\n',\n",

But when asked about their own family\\'s financial outlook, a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future. Almost 23,000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll, which was mostly conducted before the Asian tsunami disaster. The poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill, compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving. Those surveyed in three countries were split. In percentage terms, an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse, compared to 34% who said it was improving. Similarly, 48% were pessimistic about their national economy, while 41% were optimistic. And 47% saw their family\\'s economic conditions improving, as against 36% who said they were getting worse.\\n \\n The poll of 22,953 people was conducted by the international polling firm GlobeScan, together with the Program on International Policy Attitudes (Pipa) at the University of Maryland. \"While the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago, people seem to not have fully absorbed this development, though they are personally experiencing its effects,\" said Pipa director Steven Kull. \"People around the world are saying: \\'I\\'m OK, but the world isn\\'t\\'.\" There may be a perception that war, terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place, even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance, says the BBC\\'s Elizabeth Blunt.\\n \\n The countries where people were most optimistic, both for the world and for their own families, were two fast-growing developing economies, China and India, followed by Indonesia. China has seen two decades of blistering economic growth, which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale, says the BBC\\'s Louisa Lim in Beijing. But the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their country\\'s rosy economic future, our correspondent says. South Korea was the most pessimistic, while respondents in Italy and Mexico were also quite gloomy. The BBC\\'s David Willey in Rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in 2001, which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be. The Philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents\\' families, but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy. Pipa conducted the poll from 15 November 2004 to 3 January 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews. The interviews took place between 15 November 2004 and 5 January 2005. The margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points, depending on the country. In eight of the countries, the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas.\\n',\n",

Tacit approval from the White House for the weaker greenback, which could help counteract huge deficits, has helped trigger the move. But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden.\\n \\n China is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar. \"Asia should engage in greater currency flexibility,\" said French finance minister Herve Gaymard, after a meeting with his German counterpart Hans Eichel. Markets responded by pushing the euro lower, in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the G7 industrialised countries next week.

Mr Elgindy then drove share prices lower by spreading negative publicity via his newsletter. The Egyptian-born analyst would extort money from his targets in return for stopping the attacks, prosecutors said. \"Under the guise of protecting investors from fraud, Royer and Elgindy used the FBI\\'s crime-fighting tools and resources actually to defraud the public,\" said US Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf.\\n \\n Mr Royer was convicted of racketeering, securities fraud, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Mr Elgindy was convicted of racketeering, securities fraud and extortion.\\n \\n The charges carry sentences of up to 20 years. When the guilty verdict was announced by the jury foreman, Mr Elgindy dropped his face into his hands and sobbed, the Associated Press news agency reported. He was led weeping from the court room by US marshals, AP said. Defense lawyers contended that Mr Royer had been feeding information to Mr Elgindy and another trader in an attempt to expose corporate fraud. Mr Elgindy\\'s team claimed that he also was fighting against corporate wrongdoing. \"Elgindy\\'s conviction marks the end of his public charade as a crusader against fraud in the market,\" said Ms Mauskopf. One of the more bizarre aspects of the trial focused on the claims that Mr Elgindy may have had foreknowledge of the 11 September terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Mr Elgindy had been trying to sell stock prior to the attack and had predicted a slump in the market. No charges were brought in relation to these allegations.\\n',\n",

The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. The other is China Construction Bank. Both are expected to list abroad during 2005.\\n \\n They shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.\\n \\n However, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. Attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke. Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.\\n \\n China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. Last year, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. But two problems persist. First, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. Second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. Another high profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.\\n\",\n",
       " \"China Aviation seeks rescue deal\\n \\n Scandal-hit jet fuel supplier China Aviation Oil has offered to repay its creditors $220m (Â£117m) of the $550m it lost on trading in oil futures.\\n \\n The firm said it hoped to pay $100m now and another $120m over eight years. With assets of $200m and liabilities totalling $648m, it needs creditors' backing for the offer to avoid going into bankruptcy. The trading scandal is the biggest to hit Singapore since the $1.2bn collapse of Barings Bank in 1995. Chen Jiulin, chief executive of China Aviation Oil (CAO), was arrested by at Changi Airport by Singapore police on 8 December. He was returning from China, where he had headed when CAO announced its trading debacle in late-November. The firm had been betting heavily on a fall in the price of oil during October, but prices rose sharply instead.\\n \\n Among the creditors whose backing CAO needs for its restructuring plan are banking giants such as Barclay's Capital and Sumitomo Mitsui, as well as South Korean firm SK Energy. Of the immediate payment, the firm - China's biggest jet fuel supplier - said it would be paying $30m out of its own resources. The rest would come from its parent company, China Aviation Oil Holding Company in Beijing. The holding company, owned by the Chinese government, holds most of CAO's Singapore-listed shares. It cut its holding from 75% to 60% on 20 October.\\n\",\n",

Income from its vehicle-carrying shuttle services fell 7%, although 15% more passengers meant a 2% rise in railway revenue.\\n \\n The cross-Channel truck market is improving, Eurotunnel said, but warned that it was not benefiting since much of the traffic was in containers destined for ports. The passenger-only trains which use the tunnel are run by a separate company, Eurostar.\\n \\n Eurotunnel is still struggling with debts of more than 6bn euros. The company is currently kept afloat by the 200-plus banks to whom it owes the money. A shareholder revolt threw out the old board in 2004. But the BBC\\'s business editor, Jeff Randall, said the banks could yet step in and take over altogether. \"At the moment it can\\'t even service the interest on its debt,\" he said. \"This is a company in the departure lounge of life.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Water firm Suez in Argentina row\\n \\n A conflict between the Argentine State and water firm Aguas Argentinas, controlled by France\\'s Suez, is casting doubt on the firm\\'s future.\\n \\n The firm, which serves the province of Buenos Aires, wants a tariff rise of 60% to fund water-supply improvements. The government has rejected the 60% rise and wants Aguas Argentinas to make an annual investment of 400m pesos ($136m; Â£72.3m) in improvements. Planning Minister Julio De Vido has offered State help but not for \"free\".\\n \\n Mr De Vido said that the Argentine state would not make a contribution \"in the form of a subsidy\".\\n \\n He has said a contribution could be made in return for a seat on the company\\'s board. He added that the government is in discussions with Aguas Argentinas about what role it might take in the event that a State contribution is agreed. However, Aguas Argentinas told the Argentine newspaper Clarin it would not accept any change to its legal structure and, in practice, this rules out State participation on its board. The Planning Minister didn\\'t rule out the possibility of cancelling Aguas Argentinas water concession. Yet he added that he didn\\'t like to do \"futurology\". But last week, Argentine Economic Minister, Roberto Lavagna, told the French media in Paris that the government was considering allowing a 16% increase in tariffs and the possibility of a State contribution to Aguas Argentinas infrastructure investments. Speaking in Buenos Aires, Mr De Vido later denied the possibility of any tariff increase and insisted that the annual investment in water infrastructure was at the centre of the discussions. He added that in the coming weeks the future of Aguas Argentinas would be decided. Suez owns 40% of Aguas Argentinas (39.9%), while Spain\\'s Aguas de Barcelona is its second biggest shareholder with 25.01%. Recently, Suez lost a water concession in Bolivia after mass protests in the city of El Alto (the poorest in the country), with citizens complaining of unfair water charges. This forced the government to cancel the contract.\\n \\n In Argentina, Suez\\'s subsidiary, which has been fined for cutting the supply of water during a recent heat wave and allegedly failing to keep up investment to meet the demand for water, has maintained a tense relationship with the Argentine government. During the last financial crisis in Argentina, the firm sued the state alleging that converting its tariffs from US dollars to pesos, and then freezing them during devaluation, had affected the company and made it difficult for it to meet its contractual obligations. When President Nestor Kirchner of Argentina arrived in power he began to negotiate a solution to the disagreements with international utilities operating in Argentina. But he has rejected any tariff increases, alleging this will impoverish citizens further. He has also asked for more investments to meet the growing demand for water. On May 2004, Aguas Argentinas and the government signed an agreement to renegotiate its Buenos Aires water-concession contract. The firm agreed to invest 242m pesos. The issue has attracted European interest. Last week in Paris, President Kirchner discussed this problem and other issues with French president Jacques Chirac. The Argentine government is also under pressure from European Union countries and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to raise utilities tariffs, because most of the utilities operating in Argentina are European.\\n',\n",

The price of butane gas, a vital fuel for cooking, has risen to 200 dinars ($2.77) per canister from 170 dinars. Even before the hike, failing economic conditions had been fanning resentment in some of Algeria's poorest regions.\\n \\n Demonstrators took to the streets last week when the cost change was first announced, but police seemed to have restored order. According to local press reports, trouble flared up again on Saturday and carried on into Sunday. El Watan said that a number of hot spots centred on the villages and towns close to Bouira, about 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of the capital Algiers. Among the other main areas affected were the western Tiaret region and Sidi Ammar in the east of the country, Agence France Presse (AFP) reported. Riots also flared up in the Maghnia region close to the border with Morocco in the west, AFP said. Butane gas and fuel oil are used as the main source of fuel to heat homes and cook food in Algeria's remote mountain areas.\\n\",\n",
       " \"India's Maruti sees profits jump\\n \\n India's biggest carmaker Maruti has reported a sharp increase in quarterly profit after a booming economy and low interest rates boosted demand.\\n \\n Net profit surged 70% to 2.39bn rupees ($54.98m; Â£29.32m) in the last three months of 2004 compared with 1.41bn rupees a year earlier. Total sales were 30.1bn rupees, up 27% from the same 2004 period. Maruti accounts for half of India's domestic car sales, luring consumers with cheap, fuel-efficient vehicles.\\n \\n Demand in India also has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said.\\n \\n Figures show that only eight people per thousand are car owners. Maruti beat market expectations despite an increase in raw materials costs. The company, majority-owned by Japan's Suzuki, said an increase in steel and other raw material prices was partially offset by cost cutting. Sales in the fiscal third quarter, including vans and utility vehicles, rose by 17.8% to 136.069 units. Maruti is not the only company benefiting as Indian's economic growth gives consumer greater spending power. Utility vehicle and tractor maker Mahindra has reported a 52% rise in net profit during the last three months of 2004. Profit was 1.33bn rupees compared with 874.2m rupees a year earlier.\\n\",\n",

Mr Blair will focus on Africa\\'s development plans and global warming. Earlier in the day came an update on efforts to have 3 million people on anti-Aids drugs by the end of 2005. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said 700,000 people in poor countries were on life-extending drugs - up from 440,000 six months earlier but amounting to only 12% of the 5.8 million who needed them. A $2bn \"funding gap\" still stood in the way of hitting the 2005 target, the WHO said.\\n \\n The themes to be stressed by Mr Blair - whose attendance was announced at the last minute - are those he wants to dominate the UK\\'s chairmanship of the G8 group of industrialised states. Other issues to be discussed at the five-day conference range from China\\'s\\n \\n economic power to Iraq\\'s future after this Sunday\\'s elections. Aside from Mr Blair, more than 20 other world leaders are expected to attend including French President Jacques Chirac - due to speak by video link after bad weather delayed his helicopter - and South African President Thabo Mbeki, whose arrival has been delayed by Ivory Coast peace talks. The Ukraine\\'s new president, Viktor Yushchenko, will also be there - as will newly elected Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. Showbiz figures will also put in an appearance, from U2 frontman Bono - a well-known campaigner on trade and development issues - to Angelina Jolie, a goodwill campaigner for the UN on refugees.\\n \\n Unlike previous years, protests against the WEF are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. At the same time, about 100,000 people are expected to converge on the Brazilian resort of Porto Alegre for the World Social Forum - the so-called \"anti-Davos\" for campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes.\\n \\n In contrast, the Davos forum is dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world\\'s 500 largest companies scheduled to attend. A survey published on the eve of the conference by PricewaterhouseCoopers said four in ten business leaders were \"very confident\" that their companies would see sales rise in 2005. Asian and American executives, however, were much more confident than their European counterparts. But the political discussions, focusing on Iran, Iraq and China, are likely to dominate media attention.\\n',\n",
       " \"China now top trader with Japan\\n \\n China overtook the US to become Japan's biggest trading partner in 2004, according to numbers released by Japan's Finance Ministry on Wednesday.\\n \\n China accounted for 20.1% of Japan's trade in 2004, compared with 18.6% for the US. In 2003, the US was ahead with 20.5% and China came second with 19.2%. The change highlights China's growing importance as an economic powerhouse. In 2004, Japan's imports from and exports to China (and Hong Kong) added up to 22,201bn yen ($214.6bn;Â£114.5bn). This is the highest figure for Japanese trade with China since records began in 1947. It compares with 20,479.5bn yen in trade with the US.\\n \\n Trade with the US during 2004 was hurt by one-off factors, including a 13-month ban on US beef imports following the discovery of a cow infected with mad cow disease (BSE) in the US. However, economists predict China will become an even more important Japanese trading partner in the coming years. On Tuesday, figures showed China's economy grew by 9.5% in 2004 and experts say the overall growth picture remains strong. Analysts see two spurs to future growth as being China's membership of the World Trade Organisation and lower trade tariffs. During 2004, Japan's trade surplus grew 17.9% to 12.011 trillion yen, with more than half the surplus, 6.962 trillion yen, accounted for by its trade with the US. In December, the surplus grew 1.8% on a year ago to 1.14 trillion yen thanks to stronger-than-expected exports.\\n\",\n",

However, the trial was suspended when Mr Botin\\'s lawyer introduced a new set of documents on the day testimony was set to begin. A three-judge panel gave prosecution lawyers until Monday to study the documents, when the trial will be reconvened.\\n \\n The high-profile case began after two Santander shareholders filed a criminal complaint about the payments to Jose Maria Amusategui and Angel Corcostegui, who stepped down in 2001. Both executives helped Mr Botin orchestrate Spain\\'s biggest bank merger, between Santander and Banco Central Hispano, in 1999. As he arrived at Spain\\'s High Court earlier on Wednesday, Mr Botin greeted the waiting media, saying: \"I have full faith in justice.\" Santander\\'s board of governors strongly reject the charges against their chairman, saying the payouts were legal and made with their unanimous support. But if convicted, Mr Botin could face a prison term of up to six years. Mr Corcostegui, a former CEO at Santander, also asked the court for new evidence to be admitted. In spite of the allegations against him, Mr Botin continues to lead Santander, and was instrumental in the Â£8.5bn takeover last November of the British bank Abbey National. Since taking over the chairmanship in 1986, he has turned Santander into one of the top ten biggest banks in the world.\\n',\n",

The ONS says gross domestic product (GDP) rose by a strong 0.7% in the three months to 31 December, compared with 0.5% in the previous quarter. The rise came despite a further decline in production output and the worst Christmas for retailers in decades.\\n \\n The annual figure marked out the best year since 2000, and was also well ahead of the 2.2% recorded in 2003. Growth in the final three months of 2004 marked the 50th consecutive quarter of expansion. \"On the basis of the latest information the UK has entered 2005 on course to continue its record period of growth,\" said Paul Boateng, chief secretary to the Treasury in a statement.\\n \\n The ONS said the services sector, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the UK economy, grew 1.0% in the quarter. The strong services figure was welcomed by analysts, given lacklustre retail sales in December and across the Christmas holiday period. \"The fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend (growth) and I am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown,\" said Ross Walker, UK economist at RBS Financial Markets.\\n \\n However, output in the production sector contracted 0.5%, the second quarterly fall in row and a state of affairs that some economists classify as a recession. However the ONS would not comment on the definition of a recession and whether the manufacturing recovery was over. But Steve Radley, chief economist at the manufacturers\\' organisation EEF, said: \"These figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground. \"Whilst companies may be experiencing tougher conditions this year, \\'recession\\' is not a word that manufacturers would currently recognise.\" The ONS said a sharp fall in mining and quarrying, which was driven by oil and gas extraction, was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures.\\n \\n Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Gerrard, said: \"This outturn (of 0.7%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the UK economy.\" And he said the GDP figures may help to \"push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve\". \"The suggestion from the money markets is that the next move is now more likely to be in an upward rather than a downward direction. This is consistent with our own thinking,\" said Mr Rubinsohn.

Prosecutors said he was motivated by wealth - spending about $200m between 1996 and 2002 while earning much less. Defence lawyers said Mr Scrushy had been deceived by other executives. Several former HealthSouth employees have already pleaded guilty to fraud and are expected to give evidence against Mr Scrushy.\\n \\n \"We will present evidence that Richard Scrushy knew about the conspiracy, that he participated in the conspiracy and that he profited,\" prosecutor Alice Martin told the court. Mr Scrushy is the first chief executive to be tried for breaching the Sarbanes Oxley Act - a law introduced in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom frauds which obliges corporate bosses to vouch for the accuracy of their companies\\' results. Among the charges he faces are conspiracy to commit fraud, filing false statements and money laundering.

There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.\\n \\n Global business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandals in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. Across Europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called IFRS. Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.\\n \\n Already, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a \"significant threat\" or \"one of the biggest threats\". But PwC\\'s global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.\\n \\n According to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: \"One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won\\'t kill your business anymore.\" Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. Mr DiPiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had \"adjusted\" to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.\\n \\n \\n  - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.\\n',\n",

       " 'Da Vinci Code is \\'lousy history\\'\\n \\n The plot of an international bestseller that thousands of readers are likely to receive as a Christmas present is \\'laughable\\', a clergyman has said.\\n \\n The Da Vinci Code claims Jesus was not crucified, but married Mary Magdalene and died a normal death. It claims this was later covered up by the Church. The Bishop of Durham, the Rt Rev Dr Tom Wright, described the novel as a \"great thriller\" but \"lousy history\". The book has sold more than seven million copies worldwide. Despite enjoying Dan Brown\\'s conspiracy theory, the Bishop said there was a lack of evidence to back up its claims.\\n \\n Writing his Christmas message in the Northern Echo, the Bishop said: \"Conspiracy theories are always fun - fun to invent, fun to read, fun to fantasise about. \"Dan Brown is the best writer I\\'ve come across in the genre, but anyone who knows anything about 1st century history will see that this underlying material is laughable.\" A great deal of credible evidence proves the Biblical version of Jesus\\' life was true, according to the Bishop. \"The evidence for Jesus and the origins of Christianity is astonishingly good,\" he said. \"We have literally a hundred times more early manuscripts for the gospels and letters in the New Testament than we have for the main classical authors like Cicero, Virgil and Tacitus.\\n \\n \"Historical research shows that they present a coherent and thoroughly credible picture of Jesus, with all sorts of incidental details that fit the time when he lived, and don\\'t fit the world of later legend.\" Brown\\'s book has become a publishing phenomenon, consistently topping book charts in the UK and US. The Da Vinci Code has been translated into 42 languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications, including guides on to how to read the book, rebuttals and counter claims. The book, which has become an international best-seller in little over two years, is set to be made into a film starring Tom Hanks.\\n',\n",

It said the production could go ahead if the organisers \"expunge all the offending parts\". But the organisers of the play say it raises awareness of sexual abuse against women. \"The play promotes illegal, unnatural sexual acts, homosexuality and prostitution, it should be and is hereby banned,\" the council\\'s ruling said.\\n \\n The show, which has been a controversial sell-out around the world, explores female sexuality and strength through individual women telling their stories through monologues. Some parliamentarians and church leaders are also siding with the Media Council, Uganda\\'s New Vision newspaper reports. \"The play is obscene and pornographic although it was under the guise of women\\'s liberation,\" MP Kefa Ssempgani told parliament.\\n \\n But the work\\'s author, US playwright Eve Ensler, says it is all about women\\'s empowerment. \"There is obviously some fear of the vagina and saying the word vagina,\" Ms Ensler told the BBC. \"It\\'s not a slang word or dirty word it\\'s a biological, anatomical word.\" She said the play is being produced and performed by Ugandan women and it is not being forced on them. The four Ugandan NGOs organising the play intended to raise money to campaign to stop violence against women and to raise funds for the war-torn north of the country. \"I\\'m extremely outraged at the hypocrisy,\" the play\\'s organiser in Uganda, Sarah Mukasa, told the BBC\\'s Focus on Africa programme. \"I\\'m amazed that this country Uganda gives the impression that it is progressive and supports women\\'s rights and the notions of free speech; yet when women want to share their stories the government uses the apparatus of state to shut us up.\"\\n',\n",

Lyric chairman David Johnston has said that rebuilding the theatre, at a cost of Â£8m is the only answer. Mr Neeson said that the idea was to get a bunch of \"healthy, wealthy Irish Americans\" in one room and ask them to help with fundraising.\\n \\n The Oscar-nominated actor, whose films include Schindler\\'s List, Michael Collins and Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, said: \"The Lyric is too important to the cultural and social life of Northern Ireland for this building to crumble and fall apart. \"It gave me a start professionally.

Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland before the event at New York\\'s SoHo House, Mr Neeson said that his spirit belonged to the Glens of Antrim. And he said that there was one figure from his childhood that he would love to portray on the big screen - Ian Paisley. He said that the DUP leader and preacher was a \"very dynamic, extraordinary figure\". Neeson used to listen to his sermons on a Friday night in Ballymena. He said: \"What an orator.

All the category winners go through to compete for the Whitbread Book of the Year title, which carries with it a Â£25,000 prize. A panel of judges including Sir Trevor McDonald, actor Hugh Grant and writer Joanne Harris will meet up on 25 January to decide the overall winner, with the announcement being made later that evening.\\n \\n Bookmaker William Hill has placed London-based Levy\\'s novel as the 6/4 favourite to win.\\n \\n Small Island, Levy\\'s fourth novel, is set in post-war England and centres on a landlady and her lodgers. One is a Jamaican who joined British troops to fight Hitler but finds life difficult out of uniform when he settles in London.

It\\'s hard to think of anybody not enjoying it,\" wrote the judges. The first novel section was won by Susan Fletcher for Eve Green, beating the favourite Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke. Fletcher has recently graduated from graduated from the University of East Anglia creative writing course. Waterstone\\'s fiction writer buyer Suzie Doore said: \"It is great to see Susan Fletcher win in the first novel category. As a relatively unknown author this award will give her exposure to a wider and mass audience that she may not have reached and is a perfect example of the influence of the Whitbread. \"Fresh out of university she is certainly one to watch.\"\\n \\n In the biography category it was John Guy\\'s The Life of Mary Queen of Scots that was picked as winner. The judges called it \"an impressive and readable piece of scholarship, which cannot fail but leave the reader moved and intrigued by this most tragic and likeable of queens\". Guy has published many histories, including Tudor England. He is a fellow at Clare College, Cambridge and became a honorary research professor of the University of St Andrews in 2003.

       " 'Arthur Hailey: King of the bestsellers\\n \\n Novelist Arthur Hailey, who has died at the age of 84, was known for his bestselling page-turners exploring the inner workings of various industries, from the hotels to high finance.\\n \\n Born in Luton, Bedfordshire, on 5 April 1920, Hailey was the only child of working class parents, They could not afford to keep him in school beyond the age of 14. He served as a pilot with the Royal Air Force during World War II, flying fighter planes to the Middle East. It was an occupation that was later to feature in his authorial debut, the television screenplay Flight into Danger. Hailey emigrated to Canada in 1947, where he eventually became a citizen. He wanted to be a writer from an early age, but did not take it up professionally until his mid-thirties, when he was inspired to write his first screenplay while on a return flight to Toronto.\\n \\n \"I fell to daydreaming. I visualised the pilots at the controls and wondered what would happen if they both got sick. Could I fly the airplane? I was a rusty wartime pilot who hadn\\'t flown for nine years... \" Hailey later recalled. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation bought Flight into Danger for $600 (Â£318) and it was shown on TV in April 1956. It was later memorably spoofed in the 1980 comedy Airplane!, starring Leslie Nielsen. Hailey worked as a screenwriter for a couple of years, before turning to novels. He went on to produce 11 best-selling books, which were published into 38 languages in 40 countries. Flight into Danger was adapted to become Hailey\\'s first novel, Runaway Zero-Eight in 1958. The Final Diagnosis and In High Places followed, both achieving a popular following. But it was not until Hotel, in 1965, that Hollywood came calling. The hit novel took four years to write, and stayed on national best-seller lists for a full year. It was turned into a movie in 1967 and later adapted into a glossy soap in the 1980s, starring James Brolin. Airport (1968) arguably remains Hailey\\'s best-loved work and prompted the disaster movie genre. The thriller follows events in the sky, and on the ground at a snow-logged airport, when a terrorist boards an airplane with a bomb.\\n \\n The book was adapted into a hit film in 1970, starring Burt Lancaster as the harassed aiport manager and Dean Martin as a womanising pilot, alongside Jean Seberg and Jacqueline Bisset. In a testament to the popularity of the fledgling disaster genre - three sequels followed. The writer was known for his painstaking research into the professions around which each novel was centred, drawing his characters \"from real life\" and taking up to three years to produce each book. \"I have never been able to write quickly or easily. I am too self-critical for that. I am never satisfied,\" he once said. In 1969, he moved to Nassau in the Bahamas, with his wife Sheila. Wheels (1971), The Moneychangers (1975) and Overload (1979) followed. Despite a lukewarm response from critics, and few literary accolades, Hailey was at the height of his fame in the seventies and continued to attract the attention of Hollywood producers. Strong Medicine, Hailey\\'s blockbuster focusing on the pharmaceutical industry, was turned into a film in 1986, starring Sam Neill, Douglas Fairbanks Jr and a panoply of former soap stars. The 1997 novel Detective proved to be Hailey\\'s final book, when at the age of 77 he decided to retire. Hailey\\'s health began to deteriorate in recent years, twice undergoing heart surgery. He suffered a stroke just two months ago. He died in his sleep on Wednesday, after dinner with his wife and two of his six children at his home in New Providence island. \"He had a wonderful life. His greatest ambition was to see his name on a book and he certainly achieved that,\" said his wife, Sheila.\\n',\n",

       " 'Obituary: Dame Alicia Markova\\n \\n Dame Alicia Markova, who has died in Bath aged 94, was the UK\\'s first prima ballerina of the modern age, and, in her heyday, the greatest in the western world.\\n \\n She was born Lilian Alicia Marks in London in 1910. Her parents were comfortably off - her father, a mining engineer, drove a Rolls Royce. When she was eight, her mother took a decision which changed her life. Fearing that she had flat feet and weak legs, she arranged for her to have ballet lessons. Very quickly it became apparent that she was something special. She was spotted by the Russian artistic impresario, Sergei Diaghilev, who wanted her to dance for his company, Ballets Russes. She became ill with diphtheria but kept in touch, and, eventually, with a governess in tow, joined Diaghilev in Monte Carlo when she was 14.\\n \\n From here, she toured Europe, playing in all the top venues. It was Diaghilev who changed her name without even consulting her. Her life was one of great excitement. People such as Matisse and Stravinsky became like uncles to her, the latter put in charge of her musical education. Soon after Diaghilev\\'s death in 1929, Alicia Markova returned to England and became Britain\\'s first international ballerina. She helped launch the Ballet Club at the Mercury Theatre (later the Ballet Rambert), the Vic Wells Ballet, and then, with Anton Dolin, the Markova-Dolin Ballet of 1935-37. She also began working with young choreographers such as Anthony Tudor and Frederick Ashton who became huge influences on the direction of ballet in the west.\\n \\n Her version of Giselle, all lightness and grace, is still considered to be among the finest ever. She was also outstanding in The Dying Swan. She was one of the first British ballerinas to take a major part in Les Sylphides. She, above all, helped popularise ballet both in Britain and in America.\\n \\n Alicia Markova spent World War II in the United States where, in a re-formed Ballets Russes, she played to huge audiences. She even appeared in Hollywood movies. In 1950, back in England, she and Anton Dolin jointly established the Festival Ballet. She retired in 1963, an \"instant decision\" she said, \"largely because of a leg injury\". Created a Dame, she made a new career for herself as a teacher. She also travelled the world directing ballet companies and putting on shows. She became director of ballet for the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in New York, and for some years was full-time Professor of Ballet and Performing Arts in the University of Cincinnati. A critic once said of Dame Alicia Markova\\'s dancing: \"She gave the illusion of moving as if she had no weight to get off the ground.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Fears raised over ballet future\\n \\n Fewer children in the UK are following in the dainty footsteps of dancers like Darcey Bussell, and carving out potential careers as ballet dancers.\\n \\n New research from the Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) has found fewer children over the age of 10 are attending ballet classes and taking exams in the discipline. The organisation blames the growing popularity of computer games and other changes in lifestyle. And there are fears that if the trend is not reversed, there could be fewer British ballet stars in the future. The RAD found that the number of youngsters taking their ballet exams drops by almost 70% after the age of 10 or 11. Dance teacher Eve Trew, who has taught ballet for over 48 years, told BBC News she had seen a \"vast\" change over the years. She blamed modern lifestyles for the fall in ballet attendance. \"I think the children of many years ago did not have as many hobbies,\" she said. \"The trouble now is that they are wide open to computers, Gameboys and everything else children have got. \"As a result, there is less time being spent on ballet lessons.\"\\n \\n Hazel Gilbert, 23, an information manager from Newcastle, gave up ballet at the age of 10 and is typical of the problem. \"It\\'s not a very cool thing to do when you go to \\'big\\' school and I think you have to be very focused on ballet to want to carry on doing it,\" she said. \"I used to love it, but after a certain age it becomes much more disciplined and I didn\\'t want that. \"I started getting into other things, like swimming and kickboxing, and ballet just wasn\\'t something I wanted to do any more.\" Ms Trew, who runs a dance school in Gateshead, admitted it would be \"very difficult\" to reverse the trend and said many young ballet dancers were no longer willing to make the sacrifices to succeed. \"You have to be very dedicated and you have to be very disciplined. \"It is a career that you have got to really want to do because it is such hard work. \"Children these days have not got the time to spend perfecting it... that is very sad.\"\\n \\n Currently, only two out of 16 principal dancers at the Royal Ballet - Darcey Bussell and Jonathan Cope - are British, compared to 16 of the 21 principals in 1985. But a spokesman for the English National Ballet told BBC News that although only two out of their 12 principal dancers were British, around a quarter of the company\\'s dancers were from the UK. He said competition at open auditions in London was \"fierce\" between talented dancers from all over the world. The RAD have launched a new competition to try and reverse the decline in British ballet. Dame Antoinette Sibley, president of the RAD, launched the Fonteyn Nureyev Young Dancers competition earlier this week.\\n \\n Aimed at children aged 10 to 13, it is hoped the contest will help keep British ballet evolving. A spokeswoman for the RAD said: \"It is our responsibility to re-ignite the passion and nurture young dancers for the long-term future of ballet. \"We need to provide them with a framework and a goal to work towards, with constant support and coaching in an environment where they can work with their peers and possibly leading artists and choreographers. \"Perhaps more importantly provide them with the opportunity to experience \\'performance\\' themselves. \"What better way to reignite a passion for ballet than to let them experience the thrill of performance?\"\\n',\n",

Last year\\'s honorary winner, Stephen King, accused the industry during the 2003 ceremony of snobbery against popular writers. But his argument that the award should help sell books instead of honouring excellence is not shared by everyone.\\n \\n This year\\'s fiction panel overlooked high-profile works such as Philip Roth\\'s The Plot Against America and instead chose five little-known books, all by New York-based women. One fiction judge, Stewart O\\'Nan, carried around a note written on a napkin that said: \"I would hope that our caring more for the quality of a work than its sales figures make us a friend of books, not an enemy.\" The National Book Awards non-fiction prize was awarded to Kevin Boyle\\'s for Arc of Justice, which focuses on a black family\\'s fight to live in a white Detroit neighbourhood in the 1920s. The award had created a lot of interest this year after the surprise inclusion of the of the 9-11 Commission Report looking into the events of the 11 September terrorist attacks on the US. Pete Hautman won the young people\\'s literature prize for his novel Godless. The winner in the poetry category was Jean Valentine for Door in the Mountain: New and Collected Poems, 1965-2003.\\n',\n",

Rowling revealed she had completed the novel on Tuesday, ahead of the scheduled announcement on 25 December. It will be published simultaneously in the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. JK Rowling\\'s fifth book in the wizard series, Harry Potter and Order of the Phoenix was Amazon\\'s largest pre-ordered item ever, with 420,000 copies pre-ordered prior to its release in June 2003. Customers who pre-order Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince avoid standing in long queues at bookshops on the day of the book\\'s release next July. \"The fact that the book has already hit number one in our Hot 100 books chart shows how incredibly excited customers are about the sixth Harry Potter,\" said Amazon\\'s Robin Terrell.\\n \\n Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince takes up the story of Harry Potter\\'s sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as Lord Voldemort grows stronger. Rowling has already revealed that the Half-Blood Prince is neither Harry nor Voldemort. And she added that the opening chapter of the book had been brewing in her mind for 13 years. Rowling said she had plenty of time while pregnant \"to tinker with the manuscript to my satisfaction and I am as happy as I have ever been with the end result\". She also previously revealed that a character will be killed in the sixth book, but she has given no hints as to who it might be. Following publication of the sixth book, just one novel remains to complete the series.\\n',\n",

It recorded a 13.8% rise in numbers and was the country\\'s second most visited tourist attraction, behind Blackpool Pleasure Beach. Charles Saumarez Smith, the gallery\\'s director, said he was \"delighted\". He said the number of visitors through the doors had boosted figures to pre-11 September 2001 levels. Mr Saumarez Smith added that the pedestrianisation of Trafalgar Square, where the gallery is located, and strong temporary collections throughout 2004 had led to the strong performance.\\n \\n \"Our 2004 exhibition programme of El Greco, Russian Landscape in the Age of Tolstoy and Raphael: From Urbino to Rome was particularly strong and exceeded all targets,\" he said. \"The exceptional quality of the paintings in our permanent collection is also huge draw for the public. \"The expectations of today\\'s visitors are higher than ever and we have kept pace with their demands.\" Mr Saumarez Smith said he was confident the gallery could maintain the attendance. \"With important exhibitions of the work of Caravaggio, Stubbs and Rubens in place for 2005, I am confident that the gallery is set for another highly successful year,\" he added. The figures were prepared by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva).\\n \\n It found that the figures had been boosted by an increase in Europeans travelling to the UK on budget airlines. Popular cultural tourist spots such as the Tate Modern and the Natural History Museum all recorded increases of more than 10% in visitor numbers compared with 2003. But for legal or confidentiality reasons some Alva members did not submit figures for 2004, including Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Madame Tussauds and Alton Towers. Alva director Robin Broke said: \"Visits from Western Europe were up by 10% and from North America by some 9% compared to 2003, while numbers from the rest of the world rose 20%. \"European figures were helped by the rapid growth of low-cost flights to Britain from Europe, especially from new EU countries.\"\\n',\n",

Cuaron\\'s other films include Mexican movie Y Tu Mama Tambien.\\n \\n The 2001 rites-of-passage drama about two teenage boys who embark on a relationship with an older woman, brought Cuaron international attention - and box office glory.\\n \\n It also won him and his brother Carlos, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay, an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. Warner will distribute Cuaron\\'s films in several languages outside the US. \"This deal will give us the opportunity to collaborate with Alfonso on movies that make the most of his artistry and vision, and continue to offer him the mainstream worldwide audiences that our studio provides so successfully,\" said Mr Robinov.\\n \\n His first film for Warner Brothers was 1995\\'s family fantasy movie A Little Princess. Based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, A Little Princess tells the story of a young girl who is sent to live in a New York boarding school when her widowed father enlists for war. After the erotic nature of Y Tu Mama Tambien, Cuaron was a surprise choice to direct the third Harry Potter film but his dark interpretation was received well by the public and critics alike.\\n',\n",

The movie version comes in the form of a series of shorts made by Pax on a hand-held camera. Baghdad Blogger is among a number of films about Iraq showcased at the Dutch festival, which runs until Sunday. Following the fascination with the writing of Salam Pax - not his real name - he began a regular column in The Guardian newspaper and was given a crash course in documentary film-making. For the film he travelled Iraq to document the changing landscape of the country and the problems it has faced since the invasion, speaking to ordinary Iraqis about their experiences. The festival will also see the screening of Underexposure, one of Iraq\\'s first features to emerge since the toppling of Saddam Hussein.\\n \\n Director Oday Rasheed made the film on discarded 1980s Kodak film taken from the remains for the former Ministry of Culture building. It centres on the lives of families and strangers going about their everyday business as Baghdad is under siege. Rasheed said the title was refers to the isolation felt by Iraqis under Saddam\\'s regime and the difficult time the country is now experiencing. \"Saddam\\'s regime was hell, but now I think the hell has doubled,\" Rasheed said. The festival was also due to screen murdered Dutch film-maker Theo Van Gogh\\'s film about the treatment of woman under Islam, but it was withdrawn due to safety fears. Van Gogh was shot and stabbed in November 2004, following death threats he received about his film Submission.\\n',\n",

But he came back to the show in September 2003. The audience for BBC One\\'s one-hour special averaged 13.7 million and peaked at 14.2 million in the last 15 minutes, overnight figures showed. Den died after being confronted by Zoe, Chrissie and Sam in the Queen Vic.\\n \\n If the ratings are confirmed, the episode will have given the soap its highest audience for a year. The overnight figures showed almost 60% of the viewing public tuned into EastEnders between 2000 and 2100 GMT, leaving ITV1 with about 13%. \"We are very pleased with the figures,\" a BBC spokesman said. \"It shows viewers have really enjoyed the story of Den\\'s demise.\" The show\\'s highest audience came at Christmas 1986, when more than 30 million tuned in to see Den, played by Leslie Grantham, hand divorce papers to wife Angie.\\n \\n Two years later, 24 million saw him apparently shot by a man with a bunch of daffodils by a canal. More than 16 million viewers watched his return in 2003. The show\\'s ratings have since settled down to about 12 million per episode.

       " 'Redford\\'s vision of Sundance\\n \\n Despite sporting a corduroy cap pulled low over his face plus a pair of dark glasses, Robert Redford cuts an unmistakable figure through the star-struck crowds at Sundance.\\n \\n It\\'s a rare downtown appearance for the man who started the annual festival in Park City, Utah back in the 1980s. Now in its twenty-first year, Sundance continues to grow. Some 45,000 people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind. It\\'s an opportunity to meet and make deals. Redford wanted Sundance to be a platform for independent film-makers, but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream.\\n \\n Smaller festivals like Slamdance and XDance, which take place during the same week in Park City, are competing for Sundance\\'s limelight. But Redford is not worried. \"The more the merrier,\" he says. \"The point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them. \"Once independent film had a place where the work could be seen, suddenly the merchants came. With them the celebrities came, then the paparazzi - and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone,\" explains Redford.\\n \\n \"People started to say we had gone mainstream and Hollywood, but actually Hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film,\" he adds. International film-makers have always been celebrated here, but 2005 is the first year a dedicated World Dramatic and Documentary competition is being held.\\n \\n Redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the American media fails to reflect, particularly how the US is perceived internationally. He has never hidden the fact that he is a Democrat. But he reserves particular disdain for the current Republican administration. \"It\\'s the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration,\" he says. \"I think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view. That\\'s very unhealthy and very dangerous.\\n \\n \"If we take that policy into the world, there will be the same victims and the same consequences.\" Sundance isn\\'t just one big screening. There are discussion panels and Q&A sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like America\\'s \"culture wars\" and the Iraq war. While Redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent, the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic. Educated, middle class and predominantly white Americans comes Sundance, with views from the same end of the political spectrum - anti-war and socially liberal. But Redford knows this and started the Sundance TV Channel in an effort to reach a wider audience. \"When you look at the films here, what we are presenting is very much egalitarian. And it\\'s about good films and good story-telling be it African America, Asian, women, gay, lesbian. \"Sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say \\'it\\'s just a film by so-and so\\'.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"DVD review: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\n \\n This third Harry Potter film brought a change of director and a dramatic visual shake-up that really shines on DVD.\\n \\n Gone are the warm, bright colours found in the two earlier films, Alfonso Cuaron brings in a bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous - and looks even better here than in the cinema. It is all part of the progression of Harry's story into darker areas, but you'll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful Hogwarts landscape.\\n \\n This is the first Potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book. It is the third year at Hogwarts and studies are interrupted, as they always are, by a calamity that only Harry, Ron and Hermione can put right.\\n \\n It sounds corny. But Harry is no longer the winsome hero, he is a moody teenager and Daniel Radcliffe pulls it off very well. Emma Watson is ever better as Hermione, and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson. The film itself is the reason to buy this DVD. But it is laden with behind-the-scenes extras, including funny, if shallow, interviews with all the main cast. But what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch. Younger viewers will go for the games which include a Magic You May Have Missed memory test, and Crookshanks chasing off after Scabbers. Adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes. You will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage - and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it, as we did on the first Harry Potter DVD. The most interesting pieces are an interview with JK Rowling in Creating The Vision and Conjuring A Scene, a short featurette about the making of the film's big moments.\\n\",\n",

Polar Express is based on a children\\'s book which tells the story of a young boy\\'s journey to meet Santa Claus. The 48-year-old actor crossed a three-metre high bridge built in the square, which he said was \"almost impossible to get across\". Hundreds of fans greeted the star, all wearing Santa hats, and mince pies were on offer.

Polar Express uses technology similar to that used in Lord of the Rings to bring Gollum to life.

It is directed by Robert Zemeckis, who has previously worked with Hanks on Forrest Gump and Castaway.\\n',\n",

The Caribbean island\\'s government said Disney planned to film in Dominica. The Caribs have long denied their ancestors practised cannibalism. Disney was unavailable for comment. \"Our ancestors stood up against early European conquerors and because they stood up...we were labelled savages and cannibals up to today,\" said Mr Williams.\\n \\n \"This cannot be perpetuated in movies.\" Shooting on the sequel is expected to begin in April, with hundreds of Dominicans applying to be extras in the movie.\\n \\n About 3,000 Caribs live on the island of Dominica, which has a population of 70,000. Many Caribs were killed by disease and war during colonisation up to the 1600s. Mr Williams said he had received support from indigenous groups around the world in his efforts to have cannibalism references removed from the film. But he admitted there were some members of the Carib council who did not support the campaign. He said some did not \"understand our history, they are weak and are not committed to the cause of the Carib people\". The first Pirates of the Caribbean film took $305m (Â£162m) at the box office in the US alone. The cast and crew are to work on two sequels back-to-back, with the first to be released in 2006.\\n',\n",

But he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film Oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees. The Oscars organisers have picked two of The Aviator's four producers to be nominated for best film.\\n \\n Up to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby failed to trim their credits - so the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (Ampas) has done it for them. The Aviator's nominated producers are Michael Mann and Graham King - with Mr Evans and Sandy Climan, Mr Mann's former deputy, left off. Mr Evans sued Mr Mann in 2001, claiming he came up with the idea, spent years developing it and persuaded DiCaprio to play Hughes - but said he was later excluded from the project. The two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact Mr Evans' name has appeared as a producer when the film's credits roll. At the Golden Globes, Mr Evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with DiCaprio, director Martin Scorsese, Mr Mann and Mr King.\\n \\n Ampas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after Shakespeare in Love's victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards.

Controversial biopic Kinsey, starring Liam Neeson as sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, was one of four films to get four nominations. The awards, now in their 20th year, honour quirky low-budget films, all of which must have a degree of independent financing.

Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ\\'s life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (Â£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios.

He frequently collaborated with director Spike Lee, starring in seven Lee films including Jungle Fever, Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X. Attallah Shabazz, the daughter of activist Malcolm X, recalled the famous eulogy delivered by Davis at her father\\'s funeral. \"Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its finest hopes,\" she said, quoting the man she knew as Uncle Ossie. \"Ditto.\" \"Ossie was my hero, and he still is,\" said Aviator star Alan Alda, a family friend for over forty years. \"Ossie was a thing of beauty.\"\\n \\n \"I want so badly someday to have his dignity - a little of it anyway,\" added Burt Reynolds, Davis\\'s co-star in the 90s TV comedy Evening Shade. Before the midday funeral, scores of Harlem residents formed a queue outside the church to pay their respects to Davis. \"It is hard to fathom that we will no longer be able to call on his wisdom, his humour, his loyalty and his moral strength to guide us in the choices that are yet to be made and the battles that are yet to be fought,\" said Belafonte, himself an ardent civil rights activist who had been friends with Davis for over 60 years. \"But how fortunate we were to have him as long as we did.\"\\n',\n",

The lawsuit said Willis has endured \"extreme mental, physical and emotional pain and suffering.\" There were no specific details on the injuries. While Willis does not seek specific monetary damages, the lawsuit noted that the star \"was required to and did employ physicians and other medical personnel\".

You'll have forgotten it all tomorrow but you'll have a fun night with the film and all the extras. There is a one-disc version that has commentaries and a Making Of but the two-disc adds more. Unusually for this kind of film, the extras don't solely concentrate on the special effects. They're covered but there's also a general Production Diary and a Post-Production feature.\\n \\n Remember the National Lottery's draw machines Arthur and Guinevere? They were more accurate than this glossy Hollywood version of the tale.\\n \\n But as long as you're not expecting a documentary, live with it: King Arthur is a fun, exciting, totally shallow experience and looks excellent. Clive Owen is the brooding king, Keira Knightly rises above her costume and Ray Winstone gives it all some grit. It's at its best in its battle scenes which are well done and are also the best part of the Making Of extra.\\n \\n Less flashy than a David Attenborough show and less detailed than a Simon Schama one, the BBC series British Isles nevertheless turned out to be quite engrossing. Admit it, the fact that this is one of the shows Alan Titchmarsh left Ground Force to present did mean that you expected something equally frothy.

Every time she went to see Brando from then on, she added, he was wearing a different gangster-style moustache. Brando was asked to screen test for the role in The Godfather, as studio executives were said to be reluctant for the actor to play the part following problems on the set of Brando\\'s previous film Mutiny on the Bounty . In fact Brando\\'s Academy Award triumph revived his career. The actor was nominated for an Oscar the following year for his role in Bernardo Bertolucci\\'s Last Tango in Paris.

Van Gogh was shot and stabbed to death in Amsterdam six weeks ago. A Dutch-Moroccan man suspected of radical Islamist links has been charged. The killing, and Fortuyn's death in 2002, convulsed the Netherlands.

The film 06/05 will become available on the internet on Wednesday and go on general release in Dutch cinemas in January. Van Gogh's movie mixes real images of the day of Fortuyn's murder with a fictional plot about Dutch intelligence services conspiring to silence the politician. The story unfolds through the eyes of a freelance photographer who unwittingly takes pictures revealing the involvement of Dutch authorities in Fortuyn's murder.

Nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film, which she has - controversially - made in a Bollywood style, including two song-and-dance routines in the film\\'s second half. \"It was serendipity really - I was offered Vanity Fair by the studio Focus Features, who had distributed Monsoon Wedding,\" Nair told BBC World Service\\'s Masterpiece programme. \"They offered me their next-best thing, not realising that Vanity Fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since I was 16 years old in an Irish Catholic boarding school in India.\"\\n \\n Since her 1988 debut feature Salaam Bombay! - nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar and winner of Best First Feature at Cannes - Nair has become one of India\\'s most famous and respected directors. She is not restricted to Bollywood, however - she followed Salaam Bombay! with Mississippi Masala, starring Denzel Washington, and The Perez Family, her first Hollywood film.\\n \\n Her career peaked with Monsoon Wedding in 2001, which won the Golden Lion award at Venice. Nair\\'s Indian-style adaptation of Vanity Fair, however, has been attacked by critics in the US - where it only reached number eight at the box office in its opening week - who described the Bollywood elements as \"jarring.\" The film has a new ending, with Becky Sharp running off for a new life in India. But Nair said that her film had picked up on the way Thackeray - who was born in India but moved to England as a young man - had seen the world. \"First, when I was 16, it was Becky Sharp, who is a completely memorable character, because I recognised myself in her - I recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies, who wanted to buck the system that they were in,\" she said. \"But it was the sort of novel I somehow kept at the side of my bed for many years, and I would dip into every now and then and suddenly get completely mesmerised again. \"As I got older and read it, I think it was Thackeray\\'s clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society, the fact that he was born in India but came to England as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider, and yet he was an insider. \"That perspective was something I really loved.\"\\n \\n Nair also defended her decision to cast an American actress - Reese Witherspoon - as Becky Sharp, despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are British or Irish. \"I cast intuitively - in my films I cast as many non-actors as I cast actors,\" she said. \"For me, it is intuition - I have to fall in love with an actor. It is a visceral response.\\n \\n \"Thackeray describes Becky Sharp as a minx. Also she\\'s described as someone who\\'s tiny, red-headed and thin. Reese had that completely minx-like irresistibility about her.\" Having won the role because she seemed physically perfectly suited to the part, however, Witherspoon then became pregnant. But Nair said that, though this had created the need for some filming tricks, it had in fact also helped the film. \"It was a self-fulfilling prophesy - when I first met her husband [actor Ryan Philippe], I said \\'knock her up, won\\'t you, I need some flesh on the girl\\',\" she joked. \"I\\'m not a fan of the underfed Los Angeles actor at all. This was, for me, about Becky Sharp being, eventually, a full-blown woman through the course of the film. \"I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom - it gave me much more to play with.\" Nair explained how camera tricks had been used to disguise Witherspoon\\'s \"bump\" in various scenes - including hiring a number of young boys in costumes to stand in front of her. \"She runs, she gets off coal carts, she jumps off horses - she does everything,\" Nair said. \"But there\\'s also a certain carriage with horses that is going to wipe the screen at a certain moment, because of the bump.\"\\n',\n",

It also won acting awards for stars Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen. Sideways is tipped to do well at Sunday's Oscars, with five nominations.\\n \\n The awards, now in their 20th year, are given to films made outside the traditional studio system, and are traditionally held the day before the Oscars. Other winners included Catalina Sandino Moreno, who took best actress for her role as a drug smuggler in the Colombian drama Maria Full of Grace.

       " 'Tautou film tops Cesar prize nods\\n \\n French film A Very Long Engagement has received 12 nominations for France\\'s Cesar film awards, despite a recent ruling it was \"not French enough\".\\n \\n The World War I romantic drama starring Audrey Tautou, was recently ruled \"too American\" by a Paris court as it was partially backed by Warner Bros. But the Cesar organisers modified their rules to allow the film to compete. The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, received best actress, picture and director nominations.\\n \\n Last November a court judged the film was too American to compete in French film festivals. Two associations of French producers challenged Jeunet\\'s right to French government subsidies, because Warner Bros was a backer. The ruling meant the movie - which was filmed in France and used French actors and technicians - was not eligible to compete for French prizes. But Alain Terzian, president of Cesar organisers, the Academie des Arts et Techniques du Cinema, said the changes in eligibility rules, which allow films \"of French expression\", were made three months prior to the court decision. Other films in the best film category include Police drama 36, Quai Des Orfevres, Arnaud Desplechin\\'s Kings And Queen, Abdellatif Kechiche\\'s L\\'Esquive and France\\'s number one film at the 2004 box-office The Chorus.\\n \\n Best actors are Daniel Auteuil for 36, Mathieu Amalric for Kings And Queen, Gerard Jugnot for The Chorus, Philippe Torreton for L\\'Equipier and Benoit Poelvoorde for Podium. Tautou will compete against Maggie Cheung , Emmanuelle Devos, Yolande Moreau and Karin Viard for best actress. Michael Moore\\'s Fahrenheit 9/11, The Motorcycle Diaries, Lost in Translation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and 21 Grams are all vying in the best foreign film prize. The awards ceremony will be held on 26 February. This year, Will Smith, star of I, Robot, Independence Day and Men In Black, will be given an honorary Cesar, along with French singer/actor, Jacques Dutronc.\\n',\n",

British actors in attendance include nominees Clive Owen, Imelda Staunton, Kate Winslet and director Mike Leigh. The Aviator leads the shortlist, but critics believe the night may belong to Clint Eastwood\\'s Million Dollar Baby. A recent poll of US pundits found Eastwood\\'s boxing drama had become the new favourite to win best film over the Howard Hughes biopic.\\n \\n If the 74-year-old does win, he will become the oldest person ever to be named best director at the ceremony. UK critics still favour The Aviator for best film, but believe the best director title will generate a close fought battle between Eastwood and Martin Scorsese.\\n \\n Scorsese has never won the best director prize, despite four previous nominations for films including Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Gangs of New York. Eastwood has won best director once before, for Unforgiven in 1993. Most experts predict the twice-nominated Jamie Foxx will win best actor for his portrayal of singer Ray Charles, while Vera Drake star Imelda Staunton looks likely to lose out in the best actress field to Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby. The UK\\'s highest hopes remain with Clive Owen, who has scooped both the Golden Globe and the Bafta for his supporting role in Closer. Actor and comedian Chris Rock will host the event, which will be broadcast with a seven-second time delay to allow censors to cut out any unsuitable content.\\n \\n \"We have the bleep machine ready, but bleeps will be used as needed,\" producer Gil Cates told reporters. However, he added that he strongly disapproved of the growing tendency to censor live broadcasts on US TV.\\n \\n He also played down fears that Rock, who is known for using strong language in his stand-up routines, might cause controversy on the night. The 40-year-old comic has already promised not to swear live on air during the show. \"Chris has a sense of humour and everything he says is really said humorously,\" Cates said. \"You need a movie star and someone who is a stand-up comic so they can deal with the vicissitudes of the show.\" Security will also be tight, with police employing a system to detect sarin nerve gas. \"We are pulling out all the stops,\" said John Miller, chief of counterterrorism at the Los Angeles Police Department. The show is \"a symbol of American culture and has the potential to be a high-visibility target,\" he added. Meanwhile, organisers have erected a canopy over the red carpet following an outbreak of torrential rain in Los Angeles over the past week. Cates said the covers would be removed if the threat of wet weather receded. Details have also emerged of the contents of this year\\'s gift bags, which are given to nominees and presenters on the night. This year\\'s bags will include a gift certificate for a luxury beach resort, a pair of mink eyelashes and a kitchen set with a year\\'s supply of tea and coffee. The event will be televised by the ABC network from 1700 local time (0100 GMT), and on Sky Movies in the UK from 0130 GMT.\\n',\n",

It is based on the children's book by English writer Diana Wynne Jones. It has registered the highest opening weekend takings of any Japanese film in the country, according to trade publication Screen Daily.\\n \\n The film is about an 18-year-old girl who is trapped in an old woman's body after being put under a spell by a witch. Its two-day takings represented 1.1 million cinema admissions, Screen Daily said. The film's distributor Toho expects 40 million people to see it in total - almost one third of the country's population - it added. The film won the Golden Osella for outstanding technical contribution at this year's Venice Film Festival.\\n\",\n",
       " 'US box office set for record high\\n \\n Ticket sales at the US box office are predicted to break records this year, with figures expected to reach $9.4 billion, beating 2002\\'s all-time high.\\n \\n Overall figures could be dampened by the lack of a Christmas hit like last year\\'s Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings. Traditionally, ticket sales during the festive season account for 20% of the annual total. Although admissions have actually fallen this year, the predicted high is down to increasing ticket prices. According to Exhibitor Relations President Paul Dergarabedian, the average cost of a cinema ticket could be as high as $6.25 in 2004, compared to $5.80 in 2002. This year some of the biggest hits such as The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9/11 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters.\\n \\n \"Many of the films that did well (with audiences) are not necessarily the films that made a lot of money,\" said Mr Dergarabedian. He added that surprise hits had come from some of the more art-house offerings such as Napoleon Dynamite and critical hit Sideways. Sony Pictures, responsible for hits like Spiderman 2 and The Grudge, are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years, with $1 billion-plus in sales for the third consecutive year. Sony Pictures Entertainment vice chairman. Jeff Blake said: \"We had a really diverse slate this year, and... certainly we pulled off one of the surprises with Grudge.\" Horror movie The Grudge cost Sony $10 million to make but brought in $110 million. It\\'s the latest in a recent trend for Hollywood studios to back the upper and lower ends of the market, whilst ignoring the middle. Warner Inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around $1.25 billion, with Disney at number three.\\n',\n",

It saw off competition from big-budget French epic, A Very Long Engagement, and the box-office hit, The Chorus. US film Lost in Translation won the award for best foreign feature. The wistful romantic comedy directed by Sofia Coppola has already won several awards, including an Oscar for best screenplay in 2004. Its late release in France made it a contender for this year\\'s Cesars.\\n \\n The low-budget L\\'Esquive depicts the travails of a group of youth getting ready to perform a school play by the 18th-Century dramatist, Marivaux. The actors are mostly amateurs and the action is set in the impoverished suburbs of Paris, home to thousands of immigrants from North Africa and their children. Kechiche said he made the film because he \"wanted to show people we don\\'t normally see at the cinema\". A Very Long Engagement, a World War I drama featuring Audrey Tautou, won five Cesar awards. The Chorus, a film about a schoolteacher who introduces an unruly classroom to the pleasures of classical singing, won two awards - for best music and best sound.

Oscar-winning director Ron Howard chose Tautou for the part, preferring a French actress to a big name Hollywood star. UK actress Kate Beckinsale had been widely tipped as a possibility for the role alongside Vanessa Paradis and Juliette Binoche. The thriller upon which the movie is based has sold more than 17 million copies and is centred on a global conspiracy surrounding the Holy Grail mythology. The Louvre Museum, scene of the gruesome murder at the beginning of the novel, recently gave permission for filming to take place there, showbusiness newspaper Variety reported.

Due to the Thanksgiving holiday, the film opened on Wednesday, bringing its total takings to $21.6m (Â£11.4m). Top of the box office for a second week was action movie National Treasure. The family adventure, starring Nicolas Cage, took $33.1m (Â£17.m), ahead of animated comedy The Incredibles - now in its fourth week in the charts - which took $24.1m (Â£12.7m).\\n \\n Last week Oliver Stone\\'s film met with scathing reviews from US critics. The film stars Irish actor Colin Farrell as one of history\\'s most celebrated leaders - a relentless and arrogant warrior who conquered much of the known world by the age of 25. In particular, its portrayal of Alexander as a bisexual has met with a hostile reception and the threat of legal action from Greek lawyers. \"Though the battles have the blood-and-sinew bravado you expect from Oliver Stone, this three-hour buttnumbathon is hamstrung by a hectoring grandiosity,\" wrote one reviewer in Rolling Stone magazine. Others poured scorn on Farrell\\'s bleached hair and Angelina Jolie\\'s unwieldy accent, which Variety called \"a combination of Mata Hari and Count Dracula\" . But novelist Gore Vidal defended the film, saying it was \"barrier-breaking\" for its frank depiction of bisexuality.\\n \\n In Sweden last Thursday, to pick up a lifetime achievement award at the Stockholm International Film Festival, Stone expressed the hope that Alexander might be better appreciated in Europe. \"One of the reasons I am being honoured here is Europeans tend to see me a little differently than they do in the US,\" said the director behind JFK, Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July.

Ray has been nominated in six Oscar categories including best film and best actor for Jamie Foxx. The film recounts the life of blues singer Ray Charles, who died in 2004.

Sony horror film The Grudge, starring Michelle Gellar, was the US' second best-selling DVD, with Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gere's romantic comedy Shall We Dance? at number three. Foxx's critically acclaimed performance as Ray has already earned him a Screen Actors Guild Award for best actor, as well as a prestigious Golden Globe.

But Spider-Man 2 breaks that rule in two.\\n \\n It's not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of Spidey versus Doc Ock and more so into the fate of poor Peter Parker. Gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning. A few effects look false but Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Alfred Molina make this compelling. The other universal rule is that DVDs of superhero films will have Making Of features only about the effects. This disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film. Then there are commentaries, trailers and a blooper reel.\\n \\n Sometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than 34 John Wayne films ranging from the Westerns and war movies to The Quiet Man.\\n \\n Now is that a Christmas present or what? Give this to someone on 24 December and you won't see them again until early in the New Year. It's not truly a complete collection and leans more toward Wayne's earlier films: there's no True Grit, for instance, though there is Hellraisers. The films look well transferred to DVD, though none has extras.\\n \\n It was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous 1979 series became a cult favourite that's been long awaited on DVD. This set has the first season of Buck (Gil Gerard) and Wilma's (Erin Gray) tongue-in-cheek adventures and it's all as camp and gaudy as you remember. But it's also a disappointment. The US DVD has this and the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price. The bigger omission, though, is that there are no extras. That's particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars Gerard and Gray had agreed to do them.\\n\",\n",

       " 'US TV cuts nudity from BBC film\\n \\n A US TV network is editing BBC Films\\' Dirty War to avoid showing the front of a nude woman being scrubbed down after a fictional chemical attack.\\n \\n It is not worth showing \"non-essential\" nude scenes when indecency complaints are \"aggressively pursued\" by US TV watchdogs, said PBS\\' Jacoba Atlas. Dirty War - screened uncut on BBC One last September - depicts a dirty bomb attack on the City of London. It is also being screened uncut on US cable channel HBO on 24 January. PBS said it will use extra footage for its broadcast, showing the woman \"from a more discreet angle\" instead.\\n \\n The US Federal Communications Commission fined CBS $550,000 (Â£306,814) last autumn for singer Janet Jackson\\'s \"wardrobe malfunction\", during which her breast was exposed during a dance routine with Justin Timberlake. Many US networks and broadcasters are now more nervous about airing nudity, violence or bad language. Ms Atlas said PBS could put itself financially at risk if it showed the uncut version of Dirty War, and it could also deter many of its 170 individual stations from airing \"an important film\". \"You want to pick your battles,\" she said. She added that PBS, which is a private, non-profit media enterprise owned and operated by the nation\\'s 349 public television stations, is bolder about screening non-fiction or historical programming. PBS is seen in virtually all US homes with TV, and describes itself as a \"trusted community resource\" serving nearly 100 million people each week.\\n',\n",

The next five days will be spent counting the voting forms and preparing the winners\\' envelopes. Best actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio is to present a statuette for the first time at the LA ceremony on Sunday.\\n \\n The 30-year-old actor, who is nominated for playing Howard Hughes in The Aviator, will join other hopefuls such as co-star Cate Blanchett, Natalie Portman and Kate Winslet as Oscar presenters. The only people who will know the Oscar winners before they are revealed at the ceremony will be the auditors who are in charge of looking after the ballot count.\\n \\n After collating the results, they are responsible for sealing the results in the famous golden envelopes which will be revealed by a host of celebrity presenters at the ceremony. Former Academy Award winners Gwyneth Paltrow, Dustin Hoffman and Halle Berry will also present prizes. The event at the Kodak Theatre will be attended by 3,300 people, including some of the best-known names in film, and organisers say they expect it will be watched on television by one billion people around the world. One current concern is the torrential rain which has lashed Los Angeles for the past week, flooding suburbs and causing mudslides. It is hoped the forecast for Sunday, for cool weather but no rain, will prove accurate. \"The last time it rained on Oscars night was in the mid-to-late 1980s,\" said Oscars communications director John Pavlik. \"We have had rain up until the day before the show many times, but for some reason the Oscar gods always shine on Sunday and we hope they will do so again this year,\" he added.\\n',\n",

But he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film Oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees. The Oscars organisers have picked two of The Aviator's four producers to be nominated for best film.\\n \\n Up to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby failed to trim their credits - so the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (Ampas) has done it for them. The Aviator's nominated producers are Michael Mann and Graham King - with Mr Evans and Sandy Climan, Mr Mann's former deputy, left off. Mr Evans sued Mr Mann in 2001, claiming he came up with the idea, spent years developing it and persuaded DiCaprio to play Hughes - but said he was later excluded from the project. The two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact Mr Evans' name has appeared as a producer when the film's credits roll. At the Golden Globes, Mr Evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with DiCaprio, director Martin Scorsese, Mr Mann and Mr King.\\n \\n Ampas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after Shakespeare in Love's victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards. The eligible names for The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby were decided by Ampas' producers branch executive committee on Wednesday. The decision also saw Clint Eastwood get his third personal nomination for Million Dollar Baby. He is now named in the best film category as well as being nominated for best director and best lead actor. The Academy Awards ceremony will be held in Hollywood on 27 February. Chinese actress Ziyi Zhang, star of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero and House of Flying Daggers, is the latest name to be added to the list of presenters on the night.\\n\",\n",

The director of the film, Vinod Pande, says the movie is not offensive and has refused to withdraw it. Catholics are planning a protest in Mumbai (Bombay) on Wednesday. The president of one of Mumbai\\'s main Catholic organisations, Dolphy D\\'Souza, says the portrayal of an ordained priest as a man of loose moral character has hurt the religious sentiments of India\\'s Catholic community.\\n \\n He called the film \"pornographic and sensational\". Mr D\\'Souza, who is also the vice-president of the Catholics\\' national body, has accused the director of the film of portraying a priest in bad light for commercial gains. Catholics have urged Mr Pande to withdraw the film to show respect to the Christian community\\'s hurt sentiments. \"Religion needs to be a personal affair and should not be a subject for entertainment or for commercial use,\" Joseph Dias, general secretary of the Catholic Secular Forum, said in a statement.\\n \\n But Mr Pande said that if the critics were to see the film they would not protest against it and would not insist on its withdrawal. He says he has no plans to cancel the film ahead of its scheduled screening on Friday.\\n \\n \"It\\'s about forbidden love. There was no agenda whatsoever to hurt anyone,\" he said. The BBC\\'s Zubair Ahmed in Mumbai says that the controversial film shows a priest in steamy scenes with a girl half his age. She apparently goes to him for help but he falls in love with her. It takes place in the picturesque southern Indian state of Kerala. The film has already been cleared by the Censor Board with an \\'A\\' (adults only) certificate. Mr D\\'Souza says he is shocked at the Censor Board\\'s decision to clear the film. Our correspondent says that India\\'s TV channels have so far refused to be dragged into the controversy and have not screened the film\\'s promotional material. Most of the Catholic community\\'s anger has come after watching newspaper advertisements and hoardings of the film. Christians make up about two per cent of India\\'s population of more than a billion people.\\n',\n",

Scholl, 21, was arrested and beheaded with her brother, Hans, in 1943 for distributing leaflets condemning the \"abhorrent tyranny\" of Adolf Hitler. Director Marc Rothemund said: \"I have a feeling of responsibility to keep the legacy of the Scholls going.\" \"We must somehow keep their ideas alive,\" he added.\\n \\n The film drew on transcripts of Gestapo interrogations and Scholl\\'s trial preserved in the archive of communist East Germany\\'s secret police. Their discovery was the inspiration behind the film for Rothemund, who worked closely with surviving relatives, including one of Scholl\\'s sisters, to ensure historical accuracy on the film. Scholl and other members of the White Rose resistance group first started distributing anti-Nazi leaflets in the summer of 1942. They were arrested as they dropped leaflets at Munich University calling for a \"day of reckoning\" with Adolf Hitler\\'s regime. The film focuses on the six days from Scholl\\'s arrest to the intense trial which saw Scholl initially deny the charges and ended with a defiant appearance. It is one of three German films vying for a top prize at the Festival.\\n \\n A South African film version of Bizet\\'s tragic opera Carmen shot in Cape Town in the Xhosa language has also premiered at the Berlin Festival.

The books tell of a battle against the church and a fight to overthrow God. \"They have expressed worry about the possibility of perceived anti-religiosity,\" Weitz told a His Dark Materials fans\\' website. Pullman\\'s trilogy has been attacked by some Christian teachers and by the Catholic press as blasphemy. Weitz, who admitted he would not be many people\\'s first choice to direct the films, said he regarded the film adaptation as \"the most important work of my life\".\\n \\n \"In part because it is one of the few books to have changed my life,\" he told bridgetothestars.net. The award-winning trilogy - Northern Lights, The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass - tell the story of Oxford school child Lyra Belacqua. She is drawn into an epic struggle against the Church, which has been carrying out experiments on children in an attempt to remove original sin.\\n \\n As the books progress the struggle turns into a battle to overthrow the Authority, a figure who is God-like in the books. Weitz, who directed American Pie and About A Boy, said New Line feared that any anti-religiosity in the film would make the project \"unviable financially\". He said: \"All my best efforts will be directed towards keeping the film as liberating and iconoclastic an experience as I can. \"But there may be some modification of terms.\"\\n \\n Weitz said he had visited Pullman, who had told him that the Authority could \"represent any arbitrary establishment that curtails the freedom of the individual, whether it be religious, political, totalitarian, fundamentalist, communist, what have you\". He added: \"I have no desire to change the nature or intentions of the villains of the piece, but they may appear in more subtle guises.\" There are a number of Christian websites which attack the trilogy for their depiction of the church and of God, but Pullman has denied his books are anti-religious. His agent told the Times newspaper that Pullman was happy with the adaptation so far. \"Of course New Line want to make money, but Mr Weitz is a wonderful director and Philip is very supportive. \"You have to recognise that it is a challenge in the climate of Bush\\'s America,\"\\n',\n",

The sequel to the Ben Stiller comedy Meet The Parents stars Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. The success of Meet the Fockers could help produce record box office revenue for 2004, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the industry\\'s tracker Exhibitor Relations. \"We\\'ve had a much stronger than anticipated final week of the year that helped the industry end on a high note,\" said Mr Dergarabedian.\\n \\n Meet the Fockers also broke the box office records for the most money taken on New Year\\'s Eve, when it made $12.2m (Â£6.2m), and New Year\\'s Day, when it took $18m (Â£9.4m). The previous New Year\\'s Eve record was set in 2000 by Cast Away with $8.5m (Â£4.5m). The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King had held the New Year\\'s Day title with $12.8m (Â£6.7m). However, Christmas takings were down 26.5% on 2003\\'s figures - which was blamed on Christmas falling over a weekend this year. This weekend\\'s top 12 films took an estimated $125.4m (Â£65.8m), a 4.3% increase on the same weekend last year. But there were no major releases last week to provide competition to Meet the Fockers or Lemony Snicket\\'s A Series of Unfortunate Events, which finished in second place with $14.7m (Â£7.7m). The Aviator, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, ended up in third position after taking $11.2m (Â£5.9m). Comedy Fat Albert - co-written by Bill Cosby - moved down the chart to fourth place after taking $10.7m (Â£5.6m).\\n',\n",

Its second new chart - the Pop 100 - also combines airplay, digital and physical sales but confines its airplay information to US radio stations which play chart music. In addition to Green Day, other artists in the current US digital sales top 10 include Kelly Clarkson, The Game and the Killers.\\n \\n Sales of legally downloaded songs shot up more than tenfold in 2004, with 200 million track purchased online in the US and Europe in 12 months, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported last month. In the UK sales of song downloads overtook those for physical singles for the first time at the end of last year. The last week of December 2004 saw download sales of 312,000 compared with 282,000 physical singles, according to the British Phonographic Industry. The UK\\'s first official music download chart was launched last September, compiling the most popular tracks downloaded from legal UK sites - including iTunes, OD2, mycokemusic.com and Napster. Westlife\\'s Flying Without Wings - a 1999 track reissued for the occasion - was the first number one of the UK download chart.\\n \\n A spokesman for the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) said the first combined UK download and sales chart was due to be compiled \"within the first half of this year\". \"Work is going on across the music business right now to make sure the new chart works to plan,\" he said.

However they said that Busted would \"reconvene in due course\". The band have had eight top three hits, including four number ones, since they first hit the charts in 2002.

Most recently they topped the charts with the theme from the live-action film version of Thunderbirds, which was voted Record Of The Year on the ITV1 show. The band have capitalised on a craze for artists playing catchy pop music with rock overtones. The trio are seen as an alternative to more manufactured artists who are not considered credible musicians because they do not write their own songs or play their own instruments. However, recent rumours have suggested that Simpson has been wanting to quit the band to focus on Fightstar. He now plans to take Fightstar on tour.\\n',\n",

The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the star\\'s legal team was hit by family illness. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors\\' responses made public.\\n \\n \"The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case,\" a motion by Mr Jackson\\'s lawyers stated.

Mr Knight, founder of Death Row Records, served a 10-month jail term in 2004 for punching a man while on parole for an assault conviction. Police said Mr Knight was stopped on Saturday after performing an illegal U-turn and a search of his car allegedly found marijuana.\\n \\n He is also accused of not having insurance.

Mr Knight, 39, was jailed in October 1996 following his involvement in a fight with a rival gang just hours before rapper Tupac Shakur was killed in a Las Vegas drive-by shooting. He was driving Shakur\\'s car at the time and was shot in the head. At the time he was on probation for assaulting two musicians. Mr Knight, a former bodyguard, set up Death Row records in the early 1990s with Shakur and Dr Dre among his protegees.

His team assembled wherever his gigs were. We played in Brazil against some World Cup-winning players.\"\\n \\n : It was always a struggle for him to connect with Black America. Reggae did not correspond with disco in the 70s. But Bob in the 1990s became one of the great icons in America and the Third World. \"In 1991, ten years after his death, he sold more records than at any time during his life. \"We saw Black America taking Bob into their hearts for the first time.\"\\n \\n : \"Bob, in worldwide terms, is the greatest music star there has ever been. If you went to Africa he would be recognised everywhere, in places John Lennon or Elvis wouldn\\'t be. \"No disrespect to the other artists but a case can be made for him as the greatest, the best and the most influential artist in popular music.\"\\n \\n : Well 1981 was to be the year he toured Africa with Stevie Wonder. He had only performed in Zimbabwe and Guinea before. \"Of course the 1981 tour never happened, but the whole of Africa would have embraced him. We can\\'t speculate but he was at the height of his powers and just 36 years old. I had no sense his career was going to go downhill.\"\\n \\n : \"Bob was endlessly optimistic about the way Africa would turn out. He realised that nothing was perfect but he had total belief in the power of mankind. \"I\\'m sure if he were alive today he would believe Africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the Aids epidemic.\"\\n \\n : \"The final tune of his final album was Redemption Song - one of the most incredible classics of all time.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Belle named \\'best Scottish band\\'\\n \\n Belle & Sebastian have been named the best Scottish band of all time after a three month-long public poll.\\n \\n The group beat Travis and Idlewild into second and third place respectively. Franz Ferdinand, who recently picked up five Brit Award nominations, ended up in 15th place, while the Eurythmics wound up at a lowly 38. Other Scottish acts, such as the Mull Historical Society who also featured in the top 50, performed at a party in Glasgow where the result was announced. Scottish-based band Snow Patrol, who finished 14th in the vote and have been nominated for a pair of Brit Awards, were among the performers who covered well-known Scottish pop songs at the party on Wednesday night.\\n \\n Indie stalwarts Belle & Sebastian have enjoyed a chart career stretching back to 1997. They were the surprise winners of the Brit Award for best breakthrough act two years later. Scottish bands from earlier musical eras also made it into the final list, including 1970s tartan boy band the Bay City Rollers and goth favourites the Jesus and Mary Chain.\\n \\n Scottish magazine The List recently compiled a list of the top 50 Scottish bands of all time, but left the final decision to the public. The magazine\\'s music editor Mark Robertson said: \"The idea behind the project was simple - to rediscover the very best of Scottish music, from the finest musical talent spanning from the age of 70s rock through to 80s pop, right up to today\\'s international stars.\" \"Everyone has strong opinions about this and we wanted to open it up to the public to decide,\" he added. BBC Radio Scotland presenter Vic Galloway, who has been involved in the project, said it had been \"great fun\" to look back at Scotland\\'s musical heritage and take note of up-and-coming Scottish acts.\\n',\n",
       " 'Dance music not dead says Fatboy\\n \\n DJ Norman Cook - aka Fatboy Slim - has said that dance music is not dead, but has admitted it is currently going through a \"fallow patch\".\\n \\n The commercial failure of the latest albums by Britain\\'s two biggest dance acts - Fatboy Slim\\'s Palookaville and The Prodigy\\'s Always Outnumbered Never Outgunned - has been coupled with the closure of many \"superclubs,\" and the folding of three dance music magazines. Last month the Brit Awards announced they would no longer be awarding a Best Dance Act prize, with the Brits committee announcing that \"dance music is no longer where it\\'s happening in music.\" These developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre. Cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album, Halfway Between The Gutter And The Stars, but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over. \"Every week when I was making the album, I was reading articles about the demise of dance music - and obviously that affects you somewhat,\" he told BBC World Service\\'s The Ticket programme. \"I personally don\\'t believe it\\'s either dead or going to die, but it\\'s going through a bit of a fallow patch. \"So I think, consciously or subconsciously, reading every week that dance music was dead I would think \\'right, scrub that track then\\'.\"\\n \\n Although his album sales in the UK are down - Palookaville stayed in the UK top 75 for just three weeks - Cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties. And event on Brighton sea front in 2002 attracted 250,000, people, while a later one in Rio achieved a crowd of 360,000. The DVD of the Rio set was the biggest seller of that year.\\n \\n \"With a crowd that big, if the weather\\'s nice, the atmosphere before I even go is so good that about halfway through the first record I think \\'I\\'ve got them\\',\" Cook said. \"I\\'m always really really nervous before the big ones - they had to give me Valium before Rio, because two hours before I was literally just pacing the floor. \"For some reason, especially now I\\'ve got a reputation for it, the atmosphere and the joie de vivre that\\'s already going on means all I have to do is play \\'up\\' records.\" He promised more such parties in more locations around the world - despite problems after the Brighton event, which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt. One man also died of a heart attack, and a woman fell to her death during the free party. \"We\\'re having to widen our horizons from just beaches, because there\\'s landlocked countries that want to get involved,\" Cook said. \"We\\'re doing Rio at the carnival, at the Maracana, and Sao Paolo - our new gig is famous football stadiums.\"\\n \\n The DJ admitted, however, that his massive worldwide success had a downside, with intense media interest in his personal life. In particular, he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary break-up of his marriage to Radio One presenter Zoe Ball, after she was linked with DJ Dan Peppe.\\n \\n \"The tabloid thing has been difficult at times,\" Cook said. \"Especially the me-and-Zoe-Gate - it\\'s quite scary.\" He said that he had been \"determined\" that what had happened with Ball did not affect the album. \"At first I was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldn\\'t think I was depressed,\" he explained. \"Then I thought, \\'that\\'s not right\\'.\" And he highlighted a bizarre coincidence - that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended. \"I said to Zoe, \\'I did this track called My Masochistic Baby Went And Left Me, do you mind if it\\'s on the album?\\'\" he recalled. \"She said, \\'yeah, it\\'s hilarious, because your masochistic baby did leave you\\'.\" Cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure, which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on - where Paul McCartney is a neighbour. \"It\\'s almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs,\" Cook explained. \"If there\\'s a pap at the end of the road, everyone knocks on each other\\'s doors - Paul comes round, and we warn him, because we don\\'t know who they\\'re after.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Label withdraws McFadden\\'s video\\n \\n The new video of former Westlife singer Brian McFadden has been pulled after a Dublin school complained about being associated with his song Irish Son.\\n \\n St Fintian\\'s High School says it is clearly identified in the video, while McFadden never went there. McFadden makes claims that he was beaten at his own school in the song\\'s lyrics, saying it had \"cell blocks\". The performer\\'s record label Sony BMG has withdrawn the video and issued replacements to television stations. The label believed the school name was fictitious until they received the complaint. They have said the reference to the school was unintentional and coincidental.\\n \\n The head of Christian Brothers\\' school St Fintian\\'s, Richard Fogarty, said the video implied that the 24-year-old pop star had attended his school and was abused there. \"The school has always treated its pupils with respect,\" Mr Fogarty said in a statement. McFadden makes specific references to the Christian Brothers in his song, but did not attend St Fintian\\'s. Corporal punishment was outlawed in Irish schools in 1982 when McFadden was two years old.\\n \\n McFadden, whose debut solo album is released next week, has said that every song is autobiographical and \"a true story\". Alcoholism and domestic violence are among the other topics dealt with in his songs, half of which have been written with Robbie Williams\\' former collaborator, Guy Chambers. McFadden, who quit chart-topping group Westlife in March, went to number one in September with his first solo single Real To Me. He enjoyed 12 chart-toppers with the boy band before parting company with them.\\n',\n",

He also produced Mr Tambourine Man for the Byrds, as well as other his such as Turn, Turn Turn. Melcher died on Friday night at his home in Beverly Hills, California, after a long battle with skin cancer. He joined Columbia Records as a producer in the mid-1960s, and also worked with Gram Parsons and the Mamas and the Papas.\\n \\n Earlier in his career, Melcher had hits as part of duo called Bruce & Terry, with future Beach Boy Bruce Johnston, which evolved into the Rip Chords group. Melcher also worked closely with his mother, producing The Doris Day Show and helping to run her charitable activities. In 1969 his name became linked with the Charles Manson murders, which saw the deaths of actress Sharon Tate and four of her friends at a home which Melcher once rented. Rumours circulated that Melcher - who knew Manson - was the killer's real target, because he had turned him down for a record contract. But Los Angeles police discounted the rumours, pointing out Melcher had moved to Malibu, and Manson knew of his new address.\\n\",\n",

Westlife won the award for best Irish pop act, voted for by the public, beating former member Brian McFadden. Franz Ferdinand picked up best international band and album while Paddy Casey collected best Irish male. Singer-songwriter Casey beat Brian McFadden and Damien Rice. Juliette Turner was named best Irish female.\\n \\n In the international categories, Morrissey beat Eminem, Usher and Robbie Williams to best male while PJ Harvey pipped Kylie Minogue, Joss Stone, Anastacia and Natasha Bedingfield to the female crown. The 8,000 fans at the ceremony were treated to performances from US rapper Snoop Dogg, Brian McFadden with Delta Goodrem and The Thrills featuring Rolling Stones star Ronnie Wood. Snow Patrol\\'s success came after a year in which they made a chart breakthrough with their third album Final Straw. \"I think a lot of bands should go through a wee bit of a kicking before the make a success,\" singer Gary Lightbody and drummer Jonny Quinn said. \"It has been good for us, but also hard for us over the past six years.\" Snow Patrol will support U2 on their European tour later this year - but U2 were not nominated for best Irish band and album.\\n',\n",

Green Day\\'s Boulevard of Broken Dreams is currently number two in Billboard\\'s pop chart, and tops its digital chart. Download sales are due to be incorporated into the UK singles chart later this year.\\n \\n Digital sales in the US are already used to compile Billboard\\'s Hot Digital Sales chart. They will now be tallied with sales of physical singles and airplay information to make up its new Hot 100 chart. Its second new chart - the Pop 100 - also combines airplay, digital and physical sales but confines its airplay information to US radio stations which play chart music. In addition to Green Day, other artists in the current US digital sales top 10 include Kelly Clarkson, The Game and the Killers.\\n \\n Sales of legally downloaded songs shot up more than tenfold in 2004, with 200 million track purchased online in the US and Europe in 12 months, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported last month. In the UK sales of song downloads overtook those for physical singles for the first time at the end of last year. The last week of December 2004 saw download sales of 312,000 compared with 282,000 physical singles, according to the British Phonographic Industry. The UK\\'s first official music download chart was launched last September, compiling the most popular tracks downloaded from legal UK sites - including iTunes, OD2, mycokemusic.com and Napster.

       " 'Charity single for quake relief\\n \\n Singers including Sir Cliff Richard and Boy George are recording a charity single to help raise funds for victims of the Asian tsunami.\\n \\n They hope the song will raise more than Â£2m for the relief fund. The song, titled Grief Never Grows Old and described as a melancholy ballad, was written by radio DJ Mike Read. Former Boyzone singer Ronan Keating may also take part if a studio can be found close to where he is holidaying in Switzerland. Other music stars being approached include Robin and Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees, jazz sensation Jamie Cullum, Chris Rea and Olivia Newton-John.\\n \\n Sir Cliff has recorded his vocal part in Barbados, while Boy George has recorded his in New York. Read wrote the song before the Boxing Day tragedy but had thought it was too gloomy to release. Now he plans to have it recorded by a collection of pop stars under the name One World Project. \"It\\'s a natural home for it because people kept saying to me, \\'it\\'s such a good song\\', but it\\'s such a sad song,\" Read said.\\n \\n He said the song was a slow ballad and would work with around 10 singers, rather than a \"sing-along\" like the Band Aid 20 single raising money for famine relief in Africa. The backing track has already been recorded and organisers hope it can be finished within the next week to get it into record shops as soon as possible. Read went to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), which is co-ordinating the British relief effort, with the idea the day after Boxing Day. \"I was totally shocked at the enormity and suddenness of the disaster and in tears on seeing the orphaned children wandering aimlessly in search of their parents,\" he said. Read said all the funds raised by the record would go to the DEC. \"I\\'d only be pleased in terms of what it meant for sales if it got to number one,\" he added. The charity welcomed the news of the single and said money raised would help its agencies working in the affected region to rebuild survivors\\' lives and livelihoods.\\n',\n",
       " 'Franz man seeks government help\\n \\n Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos has called for more government help for musicians, while taking part in an Edinburgh Lectures discussion.\\n \\n \"For any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well,\" he said. But Kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with MPs, at the University of Edinburgh event. \"I think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them,\" he said.\\n \\n Kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss Scotland\\'s role in making 21st Century music. \"There are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they aren\\'t self-sufficient,\" he said. \"But so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well.\" He warned musicians against being allied to a particular party, however. \"I don\\'t know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea.\"\\n \\n Kapranos and his Glasgow four-piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next week\\'s Brit Awards, including best group and best album. Their self-titled debut album won last year\\'s Mercury Music Prize and spawned three top 20 singles. He told the 300-strong audience at the University\\'s Reid Hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes. \"We say \\'I like this\\'. Because I listen to Nirvana and Korn I am a troubled individual, I\\'m riddled with angst because I listen to Chopin and Debussy, I listen to Kylie Minogue and Scissor Sisters because I\\'m upbeat and I like to party, I listen to Wagner because I like the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Kapranos said there was a general \"hostility\" towards classical music, adding: \"There is very little done to break that hostility other than Classic FM.\"\\n \\n He concluded: \"We define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity.\" Fellow speaker and classical composer James MacMillan agreed: \"We need to rediscover our ability to listen.\" Previous speakers at the Edinburgh Lectures series have included former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and author Professor Stephen Hawking. Kapranos described his appearance on Wednesday as \"more daunting by a long way\" than their upcoming Brits performance. \"I don\\'t really care about the Brits,\" he said. \"It\\'s going to be great to go down but I have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight.\"\\n \\n I think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues. Also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels.\\n \\n Rather than expecting the government - i.e. the taxpayer - to fork out, why don\\'t some of the megastars put something back in? Some of Britain\\'s wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums, concerts etc. There are far more important demands on government funds.\\n \\n If they can fund football, why not fund music?\\n \\n Areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants, so why not music? We already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music. The only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash.\\n \\n The government has enough problems funding schools and health services. If Alex Kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.\\n \\n As a Scot living in England, I appreciate the value of Scottish music and culture being a success, so I can see no problem with it! Franz Ferdinand, Travis and Snow Patrol are just recent examples of the success Scottish music can have in the world, so we should do what we Scots are good at and support our own goods!\\n \\n I think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state? The answer is most definitely no. Those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn\\'t be looking for government subsidies. I know that if I was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping I would want to finance myself until I was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship.\\n \\n Yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.\\n \\n There are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around, twiddling their thumbs on the \"new deal\". Getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.\\n \\n As long as the Government was funding real talent it would be a great move. I would hate to see more Pop Idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that Alex talked about.\\n \\n Only if the proposals make financial sense. Franz Ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they\\'d had a government grant to get started they\\'d have more than paid it back by now, so the Treasury would be making far more than it paid out. However, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they\\'re a musician. The government shouldn\\'t \"fund\" music - it should \"invest\" in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.\\n \\n I think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise. The equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people. However, I do feel this should be the extent of their role, to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there.\\n \\n I do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! They generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately, the directors are in the business for! If labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn\\'t have to fork out a great deal.\\n \\n Yeah, why not? Music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff. Pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities\\n \\n I agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but I am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer. There is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy. Perhaps we could financially penalise really bad Pop Idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. Call it a tax on music \"pollution\", if you like.\\n \\n Though I really like Franz Ferdinand, I have to disagree with Mr Kapranos. Once government gets their hand into the private sector, it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues. Many years ago, this was the case with the US NEA, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting. The solution Mr Kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations, like Save the Music in the US.\\n',\n",
       " 'Hard act to follow for OutKast\\n \\n US rap duo OutKast\\'s trio of trophies at the MTV Europe Awards crowns a year of huge success for the band.\\n \\n The latest triumph adds to the three Grammys and four American MTV gongs won earlier in this year. Andre 3000 and Big Boi\\'s album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below has been critically acclaimed since its release and sold in large quantities around the world. The double album - which saw the pair produce one disc each - topped the charts in the US at the same time as single Hey Ya! It took another track from the exponents of southern hip-hop - The Way You Move - to displace it from the top spot. The Georgia pair\\'s year of critical and commercial triumph leaves them with a tough act to follow - what can be next for a musical act that has done it all?\\n \\n G Money, a presenter on the BBC\\'s urban music station 1Xtra, thinks a hiatus is inevitable after such a sustained period of exposure - giving the band time to think about other interests. \"They might be more appearances outside the band, such as producing for other artists, while they have a number of fringe music projects. \"Andre 3000 would like to go into acting, so we might see him a film, while Big Boi already has a dog-breeding business,\" says the DJ.\\n \\n \"But in a couple of years they will be back with another album which will be a collaboration unlike their double CD. \"Their greatness has become clear with Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. We haven\\'t seen the last of them,\" he adds. OutKast\\'s musical career spans 10 years and they have enjoyed commercial and critical success in the past, with their debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik going platinum. But it took until 2001 for the pair to score their first hit in the UK with Ms Jackson, while their album Stakonia saw their fame spread beyond the US.\\n \\n 1Xtra\\'s G Money says it took the latest album, released in 2003, for him to be \"assured of their genius\". \"They have always been experimental, some of it has worked and some hasn\\'t,\" he adds. But G Money acknowledges that making the next move for a band that has reached a pinnacle can be tough. \"What can you do next when you\\'ve done it all?\" he says. With ten years of success behind them and worldwide fame, it seems that OutKast is not a name that is likely to be forgotten in a hurry.\\n',\n",
       " 'Sir Paul rocks Super Bowl crowds\\n \\n Sir Paul McCartney wowed fans with a live mini-concert at American football\\'s Super Bowl - and avoided any Janet Jackson-style controversies.\\n \\n The 62-year-old sang Hey Jude and other Beatles songs in a 12-minute set at half-time during the game in Florida. Last year, Jackson exposed a breast during a dance routine, causing outrage among millions of TV viewers and landing the CBS TV network a fine. Sir Paul, however, did nothing more racy than remove his jacket as he sang. Organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old Sir Paul for his second Super Bowl show.\\n \\n Three years ago, he was invited to perform at the first Super Bowl after the September 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song Freedom. This time, he started off the show, at the Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, with the Beatles numbers Drive My Car and Get Back. He then performed a mellow version of Live And Let Die, the James Bond theme he recorded with the band Wings. Finally, he closed the show with a rousing version of Hey Jude. The former Beatle resisted any temptation to refer to Janet Jackson\\'s headline-grabbing performance last year, instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot. The singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second \"Nipple-gate\" were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.\\n \\n Earlier, the Black Eyed Peas and Alicia Keys had provided the night\\'s other high-profile entertainment by performing in a pre-game show. Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie was dressed in a tight orange top and purple hotpants, but nothing in her performance was likely to upset TV watchdogs. After the controversy last year - which saw CBS fined a record $550,000 (Â£292,000) by federal regulators - Super Bowl organisers had turned to producer Don Mischer to oversee this year\\'s half-time show. His previous production credits included Olympic opening and closing ceremonies. The Super Bowl is watched by an audience of 144.4 million in the US, with many of the people watching are said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around the event. Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, Diana Ross, Gloria Estefan and Phil Collins are among the stars who have previously graced the Super Bowl stage.\\n',\n",

A replacement guitarist has yet to be named by Korn, who are currently at work on their eighth studio album. Welch added that he would appear at a church in Bakersfield to explain how he \"got to this place in life\". The remaining members of Korn, who are known for their hardcore brand of rock, said they hoped Welch \"finds the happiness he is looking for\".\\n \\n The 34-year-old made reference to the band\\'s aggressive brand of music and its young fans in his parting statement. \"Anger is a good thing, and if kids want to listen to Korn, good, but there\\'s happiness after the anger,\" he told his local radio station in Bakersfield. \"I\\'m going to show it through my actions, how much I love my fans,\" added Welch. Korn have enjoyed a moderate degree of chart success in the UK, with 10 singles breaking into the Top 40.

He said not holding the awards would be counter to the work the magazine has done to promote hip hop music. Rapper Young Buck has been charged after allegedly stabbing a man who hit Dr Dre as he was about to receive a lifetime achievement award.\\n \\n The rapper, whose real name is David Darnell Brown, is due in court on 20 December after being arrested on one charge of attempted murder and a second charge of assault with a deadly weapon. The performer is one of the members of 50 Cent\\'s G-Unit group, which is signed to Dr Dre\\'s record label. The man who was stabbed, Jimmy James Johnson, suffered a collapsed lung and is in a stable condition at a Los Angeles hospital. Mr Johnson allegedly approached Dr Dre, who was seated at a table in front of the stage, and appeared to ask for an autograph before punching him. During the ensuing scuffle - which involved many of the 1,000-strong crowd - Mr Johnson was stabbed as he was being dragged away by security staff,\\n',\n",

The song should also include Christmas in the title, wishes for peace on earth and lots of airplay at office parties. \"There are common musical elements linking nearly all the big Christmas number ones of recent times,\" said editor David Roberts. The book\\'s analysts commissioned chart prank group Moped to create the first Christmas single using the whole formula - the song is called Gonna Have a No 1 This Christmas by Moped Vs Santa.\\n \\n \"Everybody says that Christmas number ones are formulaic, but Gonna Have a Number One this Christmas is the first song to crack the formula and combine all these elements into one ultimate Christmas track\" said Mr Roberts. \"Surprisingly, there\\'s no Santa listed among the 8,000, top 75 chart performers in the book, so this is our chance to help Santa to his rightful place in British recording history.\" Big festive hits over the years include Band Aid\\'s Do They Know It\\'s Christmas?, Slade\\'s Merry Christmas Everybody, Wham\\'s Last Christmas and Sir Cliff Richards\\' Mistletoe and Wine.

Tickets for the June event are expected to go on sale in April. \"There is only one place in the world where you will be able to get tickets,\" festival organiser Michael Eavis said. \"That will be the official source. If you get them anywhere else, you won\\'t get in.\" Fans not wanting to carry the entrance card could present their passport or driving licence instead, he added.\\n \\n More than 153,000 people are expected to travel to Mr Eavis\\' Somerset farm from 24-26 June, but the event\\'s rising popularity has meant an extremely high demand for tickets in recent years. When the ID card idea was floated, Mr Eavis\\' daughter Emily said it would be \"quite a big step in terms of ticketing for events\" if implemented and they were \"going as far as we can\" to cut touting. \"As long as it\\'s approached in the right way, it might really work, it might really change the system,\" she said. In 2004, all 112,000 tickets for the public sold out in 24 hours. They were personalised with the names of purchasers, who were asked to bring identification, such as a driving licence, passport or household bill. But some forgot to take the right information while some touts simply offered to supply their own bills along with the ticket bearing their name.

It could\\'ve got really ugly.\" A Â£100,000 reward has been offered for information leading to a conviction. His wife Sharon, who called the police, said her wedding rings were taken from her bedside table as she slept.\\n \\n The heavy metal star said he could have met the same fate as late Beatle George Harrison, who was repeatedly stabbed in a break-in in 1999. \"I could have been badly injured or shot or anything,\" Osbourne said. \"I just thank God that no-one got injured.\" He added he was glad the intruders were not hurt. \"I wouldn\\'t want anyone to get injured.\" The singer did not want to talk in detail about his actions but when asked whether he would do the same again replied: \"Is the Pope a Catholic?\" The incident happened at 0400 GMT on Monday in Chalfont St Peter. Detective Inspector Paul Miller of Thames Valley Police said it appeared a man used a ladder to get into the house through a first floor bedroom window. \"Whilst selecting items of jewellery, the burglar was disturbed by Ozzy who very courageously tackled this burglar and pursued him from the house,\" he said. Ozzy said he was \"just coming to grips\" with what had happened and his opinion of the UK had been lowered after 12 relatively trouble-free years in the US.\\n \\n \"We lived in Los Angeles where people get shot every day and have been trailed by lots of different stalkers - and yet we come back to England and I\\'m very disappointed.\" At a press conference on Tuesday, Sharon Osbourne gave details of nine stolen items.

She said she wished she had worn them at night. \"I always take them off and put them beside my bed and that\\'s where they were, right beside me on my bedside table.\" Also taken were a pearl necklace and a sapphire bought as an investment for their daughters described by Sharon as \"one of the only 24-carat sapphires that is absolutely pure\".\\n \\n A daisy chain necklace that was a 20th anniversary present and a Franck Muller watch Sharon said was one of only 10 made were also stolen.

Ozzy came from not a very nice part of Birmingham and everything we\\'ve got we have worked our arses off for.\" \"If I choose to make an investment for my kids in whatever way I choose to make it, that\\'s my business and I worked for every God damn penny.\" Ozzy also lamented two years in which the family has been plagued by problems, including his critical injury in a quad bike accident, his wife\\'s colon cancer, their childrens\\' drug problems and now the burglary.\\n \\n On Sunday night, the Osbournes had been celebrating the birthday of singer Sir Elton John\\'s partner David Furnish.

Rock band Keane won Sound of 2004 while US rapper 50 Cent topped Sound of 2003. Other new artists in this year\\'s list include London indie group Bloc Party at second and UK rapper Kano third. The Bravery played their first gig in 2003 and have since supported bands including The Libertines, Interpol and Echo and the Bunnymen.\\n \\n They were the subject of a record company bidding war in 2004 and their debut single, Unconditional, caused a huge buzz when it was released in the UK in November. Singer Sam Endicott said he felt \"great\" about coming top of the Sound of 2005 list. \"Anyone that says they don\\'t want a zillion screaming fans is a jackass, a liar,\" he said. One of the experts to tip The Bravery was The Times\\' music critic Paul Connolly, who said they were \"spiky but in love with pop\". Chris Hawkins, host of BBC 6 Music\\'s chart show, said the band had \"great guitars and a mastery of the electro-clash sound\". \"The Bravery are proof alone that New York City is still home to hot new talent,\" he said. Nigel Harding, head of music at London rock radio station Xfm, said every track from their live set \"sounded like a potential single\".\\n \\n Unconditional reached the summit of the station\\'s listeners\\' chart within a fortnight of its first play, which Mr Harding described as \"an unheard of achievement for a debut single\".\\n \\n Q magazine reviews editor Ted Kessler said they were \"pretty-boy New York clothes horses\" with \"an unusually nimble ear for concise, yearning pop in the mould of Duran Duran or The Strokes\". Other pundits to take part in the survey included BBC Radio 1 DJ Trevor Nelson, NME editor Conor McNicholas, Top of the Pops presenter Fearne Cotton, Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis and BBC Radio 2 music editor Colin Martin. Elsewhere on the top 10, second-placed rock band Bloc Party began their rise after supporting Franz Ferdinand and UK garage MC Kano, in third, is signed to The Streets\\' record label. US rapper The Game is hip-hop great Dr Dre\\'s latest protege while Leeds group Kaiser Chiefs came fifth with a promise to lead a Britpop revival. In last year\\'s survey, Keane were followed by Franz Ferdinand, Razorlight and Joss Stone in the top five - all of whom were virtually unknown outside the music industry at that point.\\n \\n Boy band McFly were sixth while Scissor Sisters, who had the UK\\'s best-selling album of 2004, were seventh. In the survey, the pundits were asked for tips for three acts they thought were capable of reaching the top in their chosen genre, either in terms of sales or critical acclaim. The artists could be from any country and any musical genre, but must not have had a UK top 20 single, been a contestant on a TV talent show or already be famous for doing something else, such as a soap actor. Those tips were then counted and compiled to make the top 10.\\n',\n",

However, the new version of the 1984 single is not going to be released in the US, despite being sold in many countries around the world. US record shops are stocking an import version of Do They Know It\\'s Christmas, which is said to be selling very well in Los Angeles and New York. The original track was released in the US, and reached number 13 in the singles chart. British stars who appear on the current recording, such as Dido and Coldplay\\'s Chris Martin, are well-known to music fans across the Atlantic, along with U2 frontman Bono.\\n \\n Record company Universal is responsible for the global distribution of the single, which will be available across Europe, Asia, South America and Canada. But music fans in the US are still able to access the song and download it on Band Aid 20\\'s official website. In 1985, a group of high-profile American stars known as USA For Africa came together to record their own fund-raising single, We Are The World.

It is the fifth in a series of 18 reissues to mark the 70th anniversary of Presley's birth. Almost Here, the duet from former Westlife star Brian McFadden and Delta Goodrem, went in at number three.\\n \\n Like Toy Soldiers, from Eminem's Encore album, is sampled from Martika's 1980s hit Toy Soldiers.

Last week's number one, Elvis's It's Now or Never, slipped 13 places to number 14, but all five of his re-released songs are in the Top 40. One World Project Tsunami fundraiser, Grief Never Grows Old, slipped four places to number eight. Featuring Cliff Richard and Boy George, the song was written by former DJ Mike Read.

Last year, Jackson exposed a breast during a dance routine, causing outrage among millions of TV viewers and landing the CBS TV network a fine. Sir Paul, however, did nothing more racy than remove his jacket as he sang. Organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old Sir Paul for his second Super Bowl show.\\n \\n Three years ago, he was invited to perform at the first Super Bowl after the September 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song Freedom. This time, he started off the show, at the Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, with the Beatles numbers Drive My Car and Get Back. He then performed a mellow version of Live And Let Die, the James Bond theme he recorded with the band Wings. Finally, he closed the show with a rousing version of Hey Jude. The former Beatle resisted any temptation to refer to Janet Jackson\\'s headline-grabbing performance last year, instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot. The singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second \"Nipple-gate\" were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.\\n \\n Earlier, the Black Eyed Peas and Alicia Keys had provided the night\\'s other high-profile entertainment by performing in a pre-game show. Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie was dressed in a tight orange top and purple hotpants, but nothing in her performance was likely to upset TV watchdogs. After the controversy last year - which saw CBS fined a record $550,000 (Â£292,000) by federal regulators - Super Bowl organisers had turned to producer Don Mischer to oversee this year\\'s half-time show. His previous production credits included Olympic opening and closing ceremonies. The Super Bowl is watched by an audience of 144.4 million in the US, with many of the people watching are said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around the event. Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, Diana Ross, Gloria Estefan and Phil Collins are among the stars who have previously graced the Super Bowl stage.\\n',\n",

The 13 February ceremony will also include a rendition of The Beatles' Across The Universe by Bono, Stevie Wonder, Norah Jones and Brian Wilson. The song will go on sale online to raise money for the tsunami aid effort. The awards show will also feature performances from U2, Green Day, Alicia Keys and Kanye West - but the Lopez and Anthony duet is likely to be one of the biggest talking points.\\n \\n Anthony, born in New York to a Puerto Rican family, is reported to be the biggest-selling salsa artist of all time. He is nominated this year for best Latin pop album and best salsa/merengue album. The tsunami tribute song will also feature Alicia Keys, Velvet Revolver and Tim McGraw. Fans will be able to download it for $0.99 (Â£0.53) from iTunes, or purchase the video from the CBS TV network's site.

Although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample, Mr Newton said his copyright had been infringed. But the US Court of Appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition. The Beastie Boys - Michael Diamond, Adam Horowitz, and Adam Yauch - are considered to be one of early pioneers of sampling music.\\n \\n Sampling, now a standard practice among musicians, involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song. A three-judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of Mr Newton\\'s recording. That finding upheld a lower-court dismissal of the case in favour of the Beastie Boys. \"We hold that Beastie Boys\\' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of Newton\\'s copyright,\" Chief Judge Mary Schroeder wrote in her opinion. Mr Newton is a critically acclaimed jazz and classical flutist, composer, performer, and university professor. Mr Newton and the Beastie Boys were not available for comment.\\n',\n",

British Music Rights (BMR) - which was formed to represent the interests of songwriters and composers - worked with education experts to put together a learning pack.\\n \\n Songwriter Guy Chambers, who has worked with stars including Robbie Williams, has thrown his support behind the scheme.

At a debate in London to launch the scheme, Chambers said: \"I think it is important that young people receive practical and engaging learning in schools. \"These lessons will give them an insight into how the creative industries work which will help them in possible future careers.\" The education pack, which has already been requested by more than 1,600 secondary schools, is aimed at giving children an understanding of copyright in relation to the music industry. It will also teach children about the importance of royalties and raises awareness of different careers in the music industry, particularly in the digital age.\\n \\n Henri Yoxall, general manager of British Music Rights, told BBC News schools had been crying out for a resource to help them educate pupils about the issues. The scheme - which is an extension of BMR\\'s Respect the Value of Music campaign - is also being backed by singer-songwriters Feargal Sharkey, Lucie Silvas and Grammy Award-winning composer David Arnold. Silvas said: \"I think it is so important that students gain an understanding of how the music industry works when they are at a young age. \"I wish I had been given an opportunity like this when I was at school.\" Emma Pike, director general of British Music Rights, said: \"We believe that copyright is an essential part of teaching music in schools. It is vital that the creatives of the future know how to turn their ideas into value. \"Copyright education has always been important... creatives are facing more challenges and more opportunities from technological change. \"Technology is allowing people to create music and distribute their music to the public in a whole host of new ways.\"\\n',\n",

The \"pre-masters\" include a take of Jailhouse Rock, religious songs, material for his first Christmas album, and banter between Presley, members of his band and Mr Nogar.\\n \\n \"We\\'ve had them for a lot of years, and I think the people should enjoy them. And frankly, we could use the money,\" Mr Nogar\\'s son Stephen, 57, said before the auction. Mr Nogar, who died in 1994 aged 72, always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back-up in case RCA producers wanted to make late changes to songs. \"He called them his \\'ass-saver\\' tapes,\" his son said. The quality is said to be noticeably crisper than that of a new vinyl record. Because the family does not own the copyright to the music, the tapes could only be sold for \"personal enjoyment\" and cannot be copied for commercial gain. The auction made a total of $1.1m (Â£600,000).\\n',\n",

The band said they were victims of an \"unprovoked attack\" in a nightclub. But police said Gallagher kicked an officer in the chest and had large amounts of alcohol and drugs - possibly cocaine - in his blood.

At the time, police said a \"physical altercation\" broke out among the musicians at about 0200 local time. That led to one of the group being \"jostled\" and falling onto the table of five Italian guests - causing the fight, they said. The fight continued outside, where \"one of the officers was kicked in the chest with full force by Liam Gallagher... and suffered minor injuries\", they said.\\n',\n",

The DVD also includes the first performance of Smells Like Teen Spirit, the track that launched Nirvana on to the international stage in 1991. \"The band wasn\\'t always pretty, or always in tune. This is not Nirvana unplugged. It\\'s Nirvana unedited,\" said Cobain biographer Charles Cross.

The first contest was organised by the European Broadcasting Union, or EBU, in 1956, and has become an annual event pitting pop giants against musical minnows - with often surprising results.\\n \\n While some regard it as an essential celebration of continental talent, others see it as an equally unmissable parade of the reasons some countries do not normally produce international stars. The 50th annual contest will be held in Kiev, Ukraine, in May, after Ukrainian singer Ruslana won last year. The 50th anniversary special will be held in Denmark later this year because the Danish Broadcasting Corporation came up with the idea for the all-time contest. A plan to hold it in London was scrapped because of problems finding a suitable venue. Ireland has been the most successful country in the show's history with seven victories, followed by the UK, France and Luxembourg with five each.\\n\",\n",

Following complaints, the Advertising Standards Authority contacted Five to cease promotion of crime show CSI:NY. Five admitted it had sent out 55,000 promotion packs but had now stopped. The promotion material was sent in brown envelope of the type used by investigators in the series, a spin-off from the highly successful CSI: Crime Scene Investigation series, which also runs on Five. The pack also features pictures of forensic evidence from a crime scene and a wanted poster, which did have a CSI:NY logo printed in large at the bottom.\\n \\n Five said it had received 100 complaints but that it had been surprised at the reaction because it was \"obvious this material is promoting a drama\". A Five spokesman said: \"In light of the efforts we have made to make the nature of the contents so transparent we are surprised a very small minority of recipients have mistaken it as anything else. \"Everyone who was sent this promotion has expressed an interest in receiving details about this particular genre of programming on various websites. \"We have also received emails and calls from recipients praising the originality and imagination of the campaign.\"\\n',\n",

Bez reacted badly to the news that he had been nominated by five of his fellow housemates, whilst John received four votes against him.

Among the items from his homes in Los Angeles and London were countless sofas, chairs, pictures, beds and memorabilia from his past TV shows. Asked the reason for the sale, Evans said: \"I just want to get rid of it all, it\\'s just a headache.\" He added: \"It feels good to be selling this stuff, it\\'s a weight off my mind. \"Look at it all, there\\'s so much clutter. I\\'ve enjoyed every bit of furniture and every poster but it\\'s not important anymore.\" The normally gregarious Evans cut a peculiarly unshowbusiness-like figure as he sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes, wrapped in a big coat and scarf in front of his Aladdin\\'s cave.\\n \\n However, the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the British public in shows such as Channel 4\\'s gameshow Don\\'t Forget Your Toothbrush. The most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size. Sofas looked like they could seat a small party and a bed seemed big enough for four. The elaborate nature of the pieces, many custom-made, had to be admired, particularly a huge red and gold upholstered \"throne\" and a stripy deckchair from the Queen Mary liner.\\n \\n To help people in their browsing, Evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful, often comic, aside. \"Isn\\'t it great\" was the comment on the Â£1,950 throne and \"Bob Dylan\\'s old sofa - honest\" was written on a dark wood couch priced Â£4,250.\\n \\n The prices were steep by a lot of people\\'s standards but Evans said it was not deterring shoppers. \"I\\'ve sold quite a lot already.

We\\'ve all been bartering, that\\'s what it\\'s all about.\" He added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making. Vintage TV and film posters also lined the walls, including a rare portrait of Raquel Welch and an original advertising print from the Benny Hill Show. And, almost hidden at the back of the lock-up, were the two giant toothbrushes from his former Channel 4 show, although these were not for sale.\\n \\n Despite the sheer curiosity value of the sale, there was a healthy trickle of interest from the public rather than the perhaps expected crowds. Some wandered in just to browse, as they would any of the other stalls, not knowing that it belonged to Evans.\\n \\n Paul Burgess said: \"I didn\\'t realise. I thought it was just a load of junk. I should go back and have a better look.\" But local resident Francesca Detakats came specially to the stall and left happy with her purchase of an original 1960s photograph of The Who by David Wedgburg. Ms Detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying Â£350 for the print. \"If you like something, you don\\'t really count it like that,\" she said.\\n \\n Martin Hellewell, who had also made a point of visiting Evans\\' shop, said he thought it was a great idea. \"Why not, if you\\'ve got stuff to get rid of it\\'s a good place to do it,\" said Mr Hellewell. Evans has taken out the stall with business partner Pete Winterbottom. They plan to open every day if possible, although Evans did not know how often he would be there. \"We\\'ll stay definitely until Christmas and then maybe a week after that,\" said Evans.\\n',\n",

I don\\'t believe in making fun of other religions,\" he said.\\n \\n The TV host said he understood how people could have thought the musical had gone too far. \"You know, on our TV show if people use inappropriate language we bleep it out, if there\\'s nudity we cover it up, so that viewers at home don\\'t get to see any of this,\" he said.\\n \\n Asked whether he thought the BBC should have screened the controversial musical he said: \"I don\\'t know if they should have had it on television but, good Lord, if you don\\'t like what\\'s on television, that\\'s why God gave us remote controls. \"My show is about dysfunctional people and I defy anyone to watch the show and suggest to me the people on it aren\\'t to some degree dysfunctional.\"\\n \\n \"If I did a show about the war in Iraq, it wouldn\\'t make me a warmonger, I would just be doing my job to report on the war. \"In the case of my show, it\\'s my job to report on the dysfunctions that take place in society.\" The British-born presenter is in London to speak at a fundraising dinner for the United Jewish Israel Appeal.

       " 'CSI shows give \\'unrealistic view\\'\\n \\n People have unrealistic expectations of forensic science thanks to the success of the CSI TV shows, real experts say.\\n \\n Evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes, at a time when many have large backlogs, science investigators claim. Lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used. The issue was discussed at a major science conference in Washington DC. Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) and its spin-offs, CSI: Miami and CSI: New York, have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the Atlantic.\\n \\n Each episode, a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science - and the extensive resources at their disposal. \"The CSI effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic science in response to the TV show,\" said Max Houck, who runs a forensic science graduate course at West Virginia University, US. \"This TV show comes on and everyone starts watching it - including the cops and prosecutors - and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof,\" he told the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). The American forensics expert said there were roughly 200,000-300,000 backlogged DNA samples in US labs. Yet these constituted just 10% of the total test backlog, said Dr Houck. Forensic pathologist Dr Patricia McFeeley said she had started to see the show\\'s influence in dealing with the families of victims. \"What I find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case,\" she explained. \"For example, on television, the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously. But when people find out that it can take several months, they can find that very difficult.\"\\n \\n Dr McFeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people\\'s perceptions. The show\\'s influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom, making lawyers jittery. \"Prosecutors fear the CSI effect with juries because, for example, they wonder: \\'why wasn\\'t everything tested?\\' Well, in fact, not everything needs to be tested,\" Dr Houck explained. \"Defence attorneys also worry about the CSI effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut; this objective method that\\'s always accurate.\" However, he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field. \"My university course started with four graduates in 1999; we\\'re now the largest major on campus - with 400 students,\" he said. Dr Houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level: \"There\\'s more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research.\"\\n',\n",

They indicated that career progression and a lack of role models are among the main problems within such companies. The research indicated that about 10% of independent production companies in the UK are minority ethnic led.\\n \\n A minority ethnic led company is defined as one in which the majority of decision-making power rests with an individual or individuals from a minority ethnic group. The report also explored the problems faced by such companies when attempting to compete within the film and TV industries. It said they are often smaller than other companies and lack the resources, so are often squeezed out of the market by bigger firms. The research recommended that minority ethnic led companies could benefit from such positive actions as career training and business advice, plus improved communication within the film and TV sectors. \"The UK has a rich and diverse culture and it is essential that it is reflected on film and television,\" said Arts minister Estelle Morris of the findings. \"I welcome this report which I hope will lead to more doors being opened and all businesses in our film and television industries being given the same opportunities.\"\\n',\n",

Rob Da Bank filled in after Peel had a heart attack aged 65 in October. All three will play \"diverse, unpredictable and non-commercial\" songs under the banner of the OneMusic show.\\n \\n Radio 1 said the station was not trying to replace Peel, but would rise to the \"challenge\" of \"keeping his legacy alive\" with unpredictable music. The three DJs were chosen for their \"in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres\", the station said.\\n \\n Rob Da Bank is one of the hosts of The Blue Room, an early morning weekend show which plays electronic and dance music. Huw Stephens has been one half of the Thursday night show Bethan and Huw in Wales, which explores new music, especially up-and-coming acts in Wales. And Ras Kwame is host of 100% Homegrown on Radio 1\\'s digital station 1Xtra, dedicated to showcasing the best hip-hop and garage. Another change to the station line-up will see Sara Cox return after maternity leave. She will host the lunchtime show on Saturdays from this week.\\n \\n Good luck to all three of them, not one DJ could fill Peels boots so it\\'s probably a good idea to get them all contributing. This time next year I hope we are saying how well these DJs have done, but I fear this time next year we will really realise how much John Peel will be forever missed.\\n \\n Very good idea to continue the legacy without attempting to replace John Peel. Also, there will surely be a wider spectrum for international music as three top radio DJs unite under the One World name. Congratulations!\\n \\n The whole glory of John Peel was the fact he was not commited to one genre. He played what he liked across the range of music.... this is not going to be the same, and all they seem to be doing is what they already have. Bring back Steve Lamacq.\\n \\n The obvious heir to John Peel is the marvellous, wonderful and talented Claire Kember from totallyradio.com. This lady is young and fresh and is one of the most knowledgeable and likeable people in British broadcasting today. Everyone who listens to her show understands and compares her to the ledgendary John Peel.

The FCC was looking into 50 shows, including those by \"shock jock\" Howard Stern and two New York DJs. Stern recently announced he was leaving Viacom while the two DJs were sacked after their show featured a couple purporting to have sex in a church. After the church incident two years ago Viacom agreed to install audio delay equipment at its radio stations that broadcast live programming.\\n \\n It also agreed to train its broadcasters and employees about indecency laws. The agreement cancels investigations into about 50 radio and television shows, said Richard Diamond, FCC deputy secretary of communications. The shows were broadcast by Viacom-owned stations across the United States. Viacom has five days to pay the $3.5m fine, according to the agreement. The payment is not related to the FCC\\'s $550,000 (Â£293,000) fine levied against Viacom after the exposure of singer Janet Jackson\\'s breast during the CBS Super Bowl halftime show in January. Viacom is contesting that fine. It is not the first time that Viacom has paid out over indecency charges.

Although six areas are to be opened up to scrutiny the audit office should have more power to choose what it investigated, the MPs said. The call was made in a report into the BBC\\'s Freeview digital service. \"Our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of EastEnders but simply to ensure that the BBC is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money,\" said the committee chairman, MP Edward Leigh. \"The BBC\\'s spending is not subject to the full independent scrutiny, and accountability to parliament. \"Parliament requires television owners to pay a licence fee and expects the comptroller and auditor general, on behalf of parliament, to be able to scrutinise how that money, over Â£2 billion a year, is used.\"\\n \\n A BBC spokeswoman said: \"We share the committee\\'s interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well. Though in its infancy, we think the arrangements with the NAO are working well and should be given time to mature.\" The report said the Freeview digital service has had an \"impressive\" take up since its launch but the BBC must still dispel confusion about the service. The committee found the BBC had succeeded in ensuring subscription-free access to digital channels following the collapse of ITV Digital in 2002. But the fact that one in four homes could not access Freeview remained a problem.\\n \\n The report said that while gaps in the coverage were largely due to landscape issues, there was need for detailed explanations on the Freeview website and on promotional literature as to why it was not available in specific areas. The government has proposed switch off of the analogue television signal, with 2012 the most recently proposed date. The BBC launched Freeview in 2002 as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as Sky, to allow its digital channels such as BBC Three and News 24 to be seen. There have been an estimated five million Freeview set-top boxes sold since the launch and prices have fallen considerably. The corporation plans to spend up to Â£138m on Freeview before 2014 to ensure people can receive the service throughout the UK, and are aware of it.\\n',\n",

She also condemned the \"complete irresponsibility\" of adding Brigitte Nielsen\\'s former mother-in-law Jackie Stallone to the house on Monday. Nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children, Greer said. The feminist writer and broadcaster said Big Brother had behaved \"like a child rather than a parent\" by taunting contestant John McCririck after denying him a cola drink. \"I thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground,\" Greer said.

At a time when negative stereotypes of Muslims are on the increase we feel that Sky - as a major UK broadcaster - has a responsibility to challenge these insidious views, not help to reinforce them.\" But Sky denied the programme breached broadcasting guidelines. A spokesperson said: \"During a useful meeting yesterday, Sky listened to the concerns raised by representatives of the council. Sky does not believe that the episodes that it has reviewed to date breach Ofcom\\'s programme code.\" Fox TV, which shows the series in the US, is broadcasting public service announcements showing Muslims in a positive light after complaints about the series.\\n',\n",

A Radio Times panel compiled the list, taking the comedians' critical acclaim and financial success into account. Newcomers to the annual list included Nighty Night star Julia Davis at seven and Black Books' Tamsin Greig at 19.\\n \\n Lucas and Walliams won numerous awards for Little Britain in 2004, including National Television, Royal Television Society and British Comedy awards.

       " 'TV show unites Angolan families\\n \\n Angolan families who are attempting to track each other down, after being separated by nearly 30 years of war, are succeeding thanks to a hugely popular TV show.\\n \\n Meeting Point has become one of TV Angola\\'s most watched programmes, and has reunited hundreds of families. It runs daily, not only on the television but also on the radio. Every Friday, hundreds of people gather in Luanda\\'s Independence Square to record a message in front of the TV cameras, in the hope that a lost relative will see it. Many relatives have been reunited on air. \"At the beginning there was an absolute explosion - huge, huge crowds,\" Sergio Gera, the programme\\'s chief co-ordinator, told BBC World Service\\'s Assignment programme. \"Now things are a little calmer, there are slightly less people - but, after two and a half years of broadcasting, there are still a lot of people going.\"\\n \\n The media in the southern African country, twice the size of France, has been gripped by the quest of so many people to find their relatives. Hundreds of thousands of people died in Angola\\'s 30-year civil war, which finally ended in 2002, and tens of thousands of people are still missing. Many have not heard anything for 10 or more years - in all, 90% of Angolan families have lost someone.\\n \\n The idea of recording in Independence Square was modelled on a square in the Argentine capital Buenos Aries, where mothers go to talk about the dead and the missing, and to exchange news. One woman, Victoria Lapete, found her sister - the only remaining member of her family - in Independence Square live on Meeting Point. She had not seen her sibling for 28 years. \"When we saw each other, we threw ourselves into each other\\'s arms,\" she told Assignment. \"We started to cry. I felt very, very happy, because I\\'d spent so long without any family. Suddenly I had a sister again.\" However, Angola is one of the poorest countries in Africa, and the number of people with access to either a television or radio is comparatively few. This means that elsewhere in the country, the task of reuniting families lies primarily with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). In the city of Wambo, the ICRC runs the Gazetta - a 200-page, tabloid-size book which contains 13,000 names of missing or displaced.\\n \\n Their task is made much harder by the huge number of landmines dotted around the country. \"It\\'s very difficult - there are many displaced,\" stated Joaquim Sahundi, head of tracing in Wambo.\\n \\n \"As they try to go back [home], others are trying to relocate their relatives. Many people are getting injured because of that - in the villages, in the bush, there has been no clearance of mines. \"When people are crossing these areas, they step on mines.\" The ICRC also uses the media where it can, running four daily broadcasts of their lists of the missing on Radio Angola. Meanwhile, there remain massive challenges to Angolan families even once they are reunited. \"The programme of family reunification is extremely important, but for these families to remain reunified, there has to be social integration, job access, education, healthcare,\" said Rafael Marques of the pro-democracy George Soros Foundation for Southern Africa. \"Essentially the government is waiting for the international community to pay for the reconstruction - that\\'s why it has been persistently calling for a donor\\'s conference. That is just a way of detaching itself from its political responsibilities.\"\\n',\n",

However, a Big Brother spokeswoman was \"satisfied\" that sensitive information about the show remained confidential.\\n \\n The bookmaker said its suspicions had been aroused by betting for the last two contestant evictions, when people were still trying to place large sums despite odds as short as 1/14. But William Hill\\'s \"overwhelming evidence\" came on Friday when four unknown callers asked to place bets on the show\\'s surprise double eviction.\\n \\n Shortly afterwards model Caprice and actor Jeremy Edwards left the show. Mr Adams believed someone had gained access to figures which revealed how viewers were voting, and was using them to predict which celebrity would be evicted next. \"We think somebody somewhere has got them and has been trying very hard to take us to the cleaners,\" he said.

In last year\\'s survey, Keane were followed by Franz Ferdinand, Razorlight and Joss Stone in the top five - all of whom were virtually unknown outside the music industry at that point.\\n \\n Boy band McFly were sixth while Scissor Sisters, who had the UK\\'s best-selling album of 2004, were seventh. In the survey, the pundits were asked for tips for three acts they thought were capable of reaching the top in their chosen genre, either in terms of sales or critical acclaim. The artists could be from any country and any musical genre, but must not have had a UK top 20 single, been a contestant on a TV talent show or already be famous for doing something else, such as a soap actor. Those tips were then counted and compiled to make the top 10.\\n',\n",

The 22-year-old singer's family came to an undisclosed settlement over a negligence claim in 2003. Aaliyah had completed a music video when the plane crashed in the Bahamas. She and eight others were killed on the plane, which crashed as if left for Florida. Blackground Records' lawyer Frank Penski said he had yet to examine the decision and did not know whether they would pursue the case.\\n \\n An investigation into the crash revealed the twin-engined Cessna was overloaded by 700 pounds (320kg). A post-mortem carried out on the remains of the pilot showed there was cocaine and alcohol in his body. Aaliyah was a rising star in music and film before she was killed. She was honoured with a string of posthumous awards and her single More Than A Woman went to number one in the UK.\\n\",\n",

Radio 1 said the show would not try to replace Peel, but would rise to the \"challenge\" of \"keeping his legacy alive\" with unpredictable music. Peel died after suffering a heart attack in Peru in October. Radio 1 said the three DJs had been chosen for their \"in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres\". Rob Da Bank has been hosting The John Peel Show since the DJ\\'s death. He is also one of the hosts of The Blue Room, an early morning weekend show that plays a mix of old and new electronic and dance music. Huw Stephens is currently one half of the Radio 1 Thursday night show Bethan and Huw in Wales, which explores new music, especially up and coming acts breaking through in Wales. And Ras Kwame is the host of 100% Homegrown on Radio 1\\'s digital station 1Xtra. His show is dedicated to showcasing the best of UK black music and broadcasts live sessions, often giving new artists their first chance to perform on live national radio.\\n \\n All of the three DJs will continue to host their current shows on Radio 1. \"It is widely accepted that John Peel can never be replaced,\" said the radio station. It added that One Music would support both signed and unsigned talent, and said: \"It will seek out those making music for music\\'s sake rather than for commercial success. \"Above all it will provide support to emerging genres of music and styles that have not yet and may never reach the mainstream.\"\\n \\n One Music is not new to Radio 1 as it already exists as a website, offering advice on aspects of the music industry, such as recording a demo and signing a record contract. Radio 1\\'s controller, Andy Parfitt, said: \"We believe that by having a series of DJs hosting a selection of shows under the One Music title, we will ensure that his legacy lives on.\" Stephens said he grew up \"listening to John\" and that it was a \"massive honour\" to continue Peel\\'s work championing new music. The show will be broadcast from 1 February on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2300 GMT - 0100 GMT.\\n',\n",

However they said that Busted would \"reconvene in due course\". The band have had eight top three hits, including four number ones, since they first hit the charts in 2002. Their singles include What I Go To School For, Year 3000, Crashed The Wedding, You Said No, and Who\\'s David?\\n \\n The band, which also includes members Matt Jay and James Bourne, made the top ten with their self-titled debut album, as well as the follow-up, A Present For Everyone, in 2003. They won best pop act and best breakthrough act at the 2004 Brit Awards and were nominated for best British group. Most recently they topped the charts with the theme from the live-action film version of Thunderbirds, which was voted Record Of The Year on the ITV1 show. The band have capitalised on a craze for artists playing catchy pop music with rock overtones. The trio are seen as an alternative to more manufactured artists who are not considered credible musicians because they do not write their own songs or play their own instruments. However, recent rumours have suggested that Simpson has been wanting to quit the band to focus on Fightstar. He now plans to take Fightstar on tour.\\n',\n",
       " 'Franz Ferdinand\\'s art school lesson\\n \\n Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand, who shot to prominence in 2004, have won two Brit Awards.\\n \\n With their self-titled debut, Franz Ferdinand have achieved what most rock bands crave - high credibility and critical acclaim while also selling stacks of CDs. They have risen to the head of the UK\\'s art rock ranks with an album of songs that are catchy, creative and original enough to sound fresh. With a cool, spiky, fun sound previously associated with bands like Talking Heads, they hit upon a style that had been out of fashion for a while and so was ripe for another airing. Their first UK single hit number three last January, followed by two more top 20 hits, while the album has sold more than 600,000 copies in 11 months on release. In September it was named album of the year winning the prestigious Mercury Music Prize.\\n \\n On the festivals circuit, they have been one of the main attractions for huge crowds at Glastonbury, T in the Park and Reading/Leeds. They have also found success in Japan, Europe and the US. By September the album had sold 500,000 in the States and total sales were pushing two million worldwide. They have been nominated for three Grammy awards in the US as well as the US music industry\\'s Shortlist award, but lost the Shortlist prize to US band TV on the Radio. Nevertheless Franz Ferdinand were the only UK band to win an MTV Video Music Award this year, taking the breakthrough video crown for Take Me Out.\\n \\n The four-piece met two years ago when drummer Paul Thomson was working at the Glasgow art school where bassist Bob Hardy was studying. Singer Alex Kapranos was studying English at university but had friends at art school, and the line-up was completed when guitarist Nick McCarthy moved from Munich, Germany, to the city. At the turn of the year, Kapranos told BBC News Online the band were fed up with serious bands in \"that post-rock thing that seemed to be doing its damndest to avoid any bloody tune\".\\n \\n \"We want people to go away from the gigs humming the tunes that we were singing. But at the same time bringing an edge to it.\" Franz Ferdinand had a question they asked themselves every time they wrote a song, Kapranos said. \"Where\\'s the fun in that?\" they pondered at every stage, making enjoyment the top priority and ensuring they did not disappear up their own muso posteriors. The band started out with a DIY ethic that saw them take over a disused art-deco warehouse in Glasgow and rename it The Chateau. The venue soon became legendary - so well-known that the police spent a month trying to find it, eventually raiding it and arresting Kapranos. But the charges of running an illegal bar and contravening health and safety, fire hazard and noise abatement laws were dropped.\\n \\n The band took over an abandoned Victorian courtroom and jail instead, and named that The Chateau. The buzz about the band soon spread around the music industry and 40 record labels turned up to one gig in Glasgow - which the band thought was \"totally ridiculous\". \"I\\'m really glad it was almost comical because we weren\\'t overwhelmed by the seriousness of it,\" Kapranos said. They signed with independent label Domino, home of Smog, Sebadoh and Four Tet, in June 2003.\\n',\n",

She said she was \"horrified\" by the deaths of Charlene Ellis, 18, and Letisha Shakespeare, 17. Size, whose New Forms album won the 1997 Mercury Music Prize, said gun use was \"nothing to be glamorised\".\\n \\n There were more than 10,500 firearms offences and 70 gun crime deaths in England and Wales between June 2003 and 2004, according to Home Office figures. Knight said the scale of the problem became clear to her after the 2003 shootings in Aston, near Knight\\'s Birmingham home.\\n \\n \"It haunted me to be honest, it haunted my sleep,\" she said. Size became involved after two friends, Donna Small and Asha Jama, were shot in his Bristol hometown in October. Jama, 25, lost her sight in one eye while 22-year-old Small suffered serious head injuries. Size said he collaborated on the single, which was released on Monday, because he has \"a bird\\'s eye view of what\\'s going on\". \"Over the last 10 years, I have seen a lot of things happen and it is nothing to be glamorised, it really isn\\'t,\" he said.\\n',\n",

We took some time off for Christmas, but generally we\\'re doing another record,\" Barrow told the digital radio station. News of their album plans comes after confirmation the Bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam\\'s Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.\\n \\n \"We\\'ve just had our heads down really, we\\'ve never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. \"So for us it just seems, even though we haven\\'t played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven\\'t released a record for a long time.\" Portishead will not play any new material at next month\\'s concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Other acts appearing include Liverpool band The Coral and former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Dummy was a critics\\' favourite in 1994, hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.\\n',\n",
       " 'Fightstar take to the stage\\n \\n Charlie Simpson took his new band Fightstar to the stage on Friday night, just hours after officially announcing his departure from pop band Busted.\\n \\n He was greeted by a sell-out crowd at the University of Warwick. Confirmation of Busted\\'s long-rumoured split had come earlier in the day, when Simpson held a press conference in London with bandmates Matt Willis and James Bourne. All three band members stressed that the break up was amicable, although Bourne admitted he was \"devastated\" to hear of Simpson\\'s departure. \"This has been a really difficult decision,\" 19-year-old Simpson revealed, \"I hope the fans will understand.\"\\n \\n While Simpson declared he would look back with pride on Busted\\'s enormous success, his focus turned immediately to Fightstar, with Friday\\'s press conference coinciding with the start of the band\\'s 13-date tour of the UK. Fuelled by this news, all 1,400 tickets to see Charlie\\'s first post-Busted live appearance - at the University of Warwick\\'s Student Union - sold out rapidly. Mike Eccleshall, the venue\\'s Promotions Coordinator, said: \"Tickets had been selling strongly over the past few days, but sales went mad after the news broke. We had completely sold out by 4pm.\"\\n \\n With queues outside the venue long and expectations high, the pressure was on Fightstar to impress. Although many dedicated fans travelled to the gig from around the country, they faced a tough crowd made up chiefly of students, the average age of the audience far exceeding that of any Busted concert. Gone were the screaming girls to which Simpson had become accustomed. Support act Brigade, fronted by Simpson\\'s brother, played a short set first and were met with general approval. When Fightstar eventually took to the stage around 11pm, however, a riotous cheer easily drowned out any hecklers lurking in the crowd.\\n \\n Unfortunately, the band were initially hindered by technical teething problems as Simpson\\'s guitar amplifier failed to work. As sound technicians rushed to fix it, other band members did their best to improvise. When they eventually got under way, Fightstar\\'s blend of emotionally charged rock was warmly received. Far heavier and less commercial than Busted\\'s chart-topping pop-punk, the band will undoubtedly appeal to a more mature fan-base. Warwick student Helen Clutterbuck admitted: \"I came to check out Fightstar because of all the controversy. \"I\\'ve never heard them before, but I\\'m pretty impressed.\" Less impressed were fellow students Ryan Crabbe and Gordon Rennie, who observed, \"With Fightstar, Charlie has clearly progressed from Busted\\'s sound, but they\\'re still not very inspiring.\" Fightstar played for around 45 minutes, showcasing material from their forthcoming EP called They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, due for release in February.\\n',\n",

His disappearance remains one of the most tragic mysteries in rock music.\\n \\n For his devoted fans, Richey Edwards was an inspired and inspiring poet, a man who articulated their desperation and despair, who shouted the things most kept hidden. The Manic Street Preachers may only have become stadium-conquering rock giants since his disappearance - but Edwards was the figurehead for their first, dangerous and dazzling incarnation. Edwards did not feature in the original line-up of the band, though. Singer/guitarist James Dean Bradfield, bassist Nicky Wire and drummer Sean Moore were originally accompanied by a rhythm guitarist called Flicker. But Edwards replaced Flicker in time for the band\\'s self-financed debut, Suicide Alley, after designing the record\\'s artwork.\\n \\n After becoming a full-time member, Edwards became a critical part of the band, writing lyrics and playing guitar - though in many concerts, he was not actually plugged in. But the fiercely intelligent Edwards - who name-checked writers such as Sylvia Plath, George Orwell and Philip Larkin - battled depression, alcohol problems, eating disorders, and self-harm. By the time the band released their third album, The Holy Bible, in October 1994, Edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression.

Now Wilson believes rap act Raw T - signed to his F4 label, the fourth incarnation of Factory - will \"complete the hat-trick\". \"Suddenly, when Raw T came into my life, I realised they are my third major band,\" he told BBC World Service\\'s The Music Biz programme. The group are set to release their first single on 21 February, and follow it up with an album, Realise And Witness, in March.\\n \\n Wilson has twice tried to resurrect Factory - which lasted for 14 years before folding - but conceded these efforts had been \"despondent and dismal experiences\". But it has not put him off. \"Of all the things I do in my life the most exciting thing I\\'ve ever done, and the thing I have most loved, is being part of a record company,\" he added.\\n \\n \"The idea of working with brilliant young musicians, and being close to the centre of popular culture, is just the biggest thrill in my life.\" Wilson explained how his son persuaded him to go and see Raw T, but he had initially been reluctant saying he \"detested\" young British people rapping. \"It\\'s always inauthentic, it\\'s always crass, it never really works for me,\" he said. \"I went to see this group, Raw T - which stands for Realise And Witness Talent - and like everyone else in the room that night, we were utterly blown away.\" Wilson believes Raw T could be \"to F4 as Joy Division were to Factory records\".\\n \\n The story of Factory records - which also owned the legendary Hacienda club in Manchester - was told in the Michael Winterbottom film 24 Hour Party People, in which Wilson was played by Steve Coogan.\\n \\n Wilson stressed that the independent music scene remained \"as important\" as it had been during the 1980s, when labels such as Factory and Rough Trade proliferated. He pointed out that Franz Ferdinand and The White Stripes - \"perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium\" - were signed to indies. \"I think that is a reflection of how useful and how powerful the indie philosophy is, and how bands prefer it,\" he added. \"They can make more money that way - it\\'s a more generous relationship, and also it\\'s a more understanding relationship. \"I think independents are in a wonderful position at this moment in time.\"\\n',\n",

       " 'Deal to ban \\'homophobic\\' reggae\\n \\n The reggae industry is to refuse to release or stage concerts featuring homophobic songs under a global deal struck with gay rights groups.\\n \\n A damaging campaign against stars such as Beenie Man and Sizzla has been waged over lyrics that allegedly call for gay people to be killed or assaulted. The campaign, which led to gigs being scrapped and a UK police investigation, will now be dropped under the truce. Brett Lock of gay group OutRage! said they were \"wiping the slate clean\". The protests had been led by the Stop Murder Music coalition, an umbrella group including OutRage!, the Black Gay Men\\'s Advisory Group and Jamaican movement J-Flag.\\n \\n That coalition has reached a verbal agreement with major dancehall reggae record labels and concert promoters covering eight of the scene\\'s biggest stars. But the artists themselves were not involved in the negotiations and have not directly signed up. Instead, the record companies have pledged not to release or re-release any offensive songs - many of which date back a number of years. And it is believed promoters will make stars agree not to perform such tunes on stage. \"The reggae industry will work with the artists while still maintaining their freedom of speech and artistic freedom,\" according to media and PR strategist Glen Yearwood, who is representing the reggae industry.\\n \\n The industry would halt any attempt by an artist to perform or release a song inciting violence against any group or gender, he said. \"We\\'ll advise them this is not the way forward in a civilised society.\" The Stop Murder Music campaign saw protesters picket gigs, resulted in Sizzla\\'s UK tour being cancelled in November, forced Mobo award organisers to drop artists from nominations and saw Beenie Man dropped from an MTV show in August. Police have also been investigating whether lyrics incite the assault and murder of gay people. The campaign was a blow to the reggae industry, Mr Yearwood admitted. \"If you can\\'t have major stars touring, then you don\\'t sell many albums,\" he said.\\n \\n But the artists - Beenie Man, Sizzla, Elephant Man, Buju Banton, Bounty Killer, TOK, Capleton and Vybz Kartel - will not have to apologise for past songs or comments. OutRage!\\'s Mr Lock said: \"The main players in the dancehall reggae industry will attempt to regulate the industry themselves to ensure that there aren\\'t any violently homophobic or gay-bashing lyrics in the future. \"As a gesture of good faith, the Stop Murder Music coalition has agreed to suspend our aggressive campaigning against murder music. \"So we shall not be picketing concerts or calling for prosecutions to give the industry the space to regulate and reform itself.\" Record companies VP and Greensleeves, distributor Jet Star and concert promoters including Jammins and Apollo Entertainment are all on board.\\n',\n",

When they split in December, Mantooth says Mars denied any such agreement. She is asking a Los Angeles court to award her half the musician's property, a monthly allowance and damages. Mantooth added that the pair became lovers in 1990, after which she abandoned her career as a documentary film-maker to move in with the guitarist at his Malibu home.\\n \\n She is also claiming that Mars, 53, has failed to provide her with any material support since they ceased to be a couple.

The flamboyant act scored a hat-trick in the international categories, winning the best group, best album and best newcomer awards. Glasgow group Franz Ferdinand won two prizes, as did Keane and Joss Stone, who was voted best urban act by digital TV viewers. Robbie Williams\\' Angels was named the best song of the past 25 years. Scissor Sisters frontwoman Ana Matronic collected the best international album prize from singer Siouxsie Sioux.

You guys made our dream come true.\"\\n \\n The band - whose self-titled LP was 2004\\'s biggest-selling album - thanked \"all the members of the sisterhood\", adding: \"We wouldn\\'t be here without you.\" The US band, who opened the show with Take Your Mama, won the best international act and newcomer awards, as well as best international album.\\n \\n Franz Ferdinand, who were shortlisted in five categories, won best rock act and best British group, an award they dedicated to late DJ John Peel. But they missed out on best British live act, which went to Muse. Keane won best British album and breakthrough act. Will Young won the best single prize for Your Game. McFly won the best pop act prize, and Gwen Stefani picked up the best international female artist award. Eminem won the male prize.\\n \\n Best British male artist winner Mike Skinner - aka The Streets - does not usually attend award ceremonies, but the Birmingham hip-hop artist performed his hit Dry Your Eyes at the ceremony. However, he did not collect his prize. A bandmate informed the crowd Skinner was \"in the toilet\". After beating Amy Winehouse, Jamelia, Natasha Bedingfield and PJ Harvey to the best British female prize, Joss Stone said: \"I don\\'t know what to say. I don\\'t like doing this at all. I\\'d like to thank my family for being really supportive and everybody that made my record with me.\" \"I don\\'t even know what to do right now. Thank you all you guys for voting for me, I feel sick right now.\" Viewers of digital music TV channel MTV Base voted Stone the winner in the best urban act category.\\n \\n Little Britain comedy duo Matt Lucas and David Walliams presented the best song prize to Robbie Williams dressed as his former Take That colleagues Gary Barlow and Howard Donald, leading him to quip he was \"always the talented man of the band\".\\n \\n Williams\\' track beat songs by Will Young, Queen, Kate Bush and Joy Division in a vote by BBC Radio 2 listeners to mark 25 years of the UK music industry ceremony. It is his 15th Brit award, having already received 10 solo awards and four with Take That. He told the audience: \"I\\'m just amazed that my career keeps going.\" Keane frontman Tom Chaplin thanked fans for enduring \"rubbish gigs\" after they won the British breakthrough act prize. He added: \"A lot of people don\\'t think it\\'s cool that we\\'ve had the guts to be ourselves but it\\'s a vital part of who we are as a band and receiving this is recognition of that.\"\\n \\n Natasha Bedingfield - in the running for best British female and best pop act - performed with her brother Daniel for the first time at Wednesday\\'s event.\\n \\n The chart-topping siblings duetted on the Chaka Khan hit Ain\\'t Nobody.

Scissor Sisters, Franz Ferdinand, Keane, Joss Stone and McFly were all in the Sound of 2004 top 10. The other five Brits winners were already established before Sound of 2004 was compiled. The ceremony will be televised on ITV1 on Thursday.\\n \\n \\n \\n I\\'m speechless. Best song of the last 25 years? Yeah right.\\n \\n I very much doubt that \\'Angels\\' was even the best song of the week that it came out. Like every track Robbie has released as a single, it\\'s a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before.\\n \\n Give us a break...!!!\\n \\n Best song in 25 years, you must be joking. Its good if you like that sort of thing, but really!\\n \\n Listened to Angels on Radio 1 this morning when I was driving into work. Had not heard it for a while. I love Robs voice, the lyrics and tune. Perfection!\\n \\n As usual, the public have short memories when it comes to voting for \"the greatest\". There must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more. It\\'s not exactly groundbreaking. Presumably, the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low...\\n \\n I\\'m actually embarrassed to be British if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years!!\\n \\n What about The Specials - Ghost Town, The Buzzcocks - Ever Fallen in Love With Someone... Happy Mondays - Kinky Afro, McAlmont & Butler - Yes, Joy Division - Love Will Tear Us Apart... Angels is middle-of-the-road rubbish.\\n \\n Angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap. It\\'s musically and lyrically inept; and fantastically overrated, a bit like Mr Williams himself. This result isn\\'t very surprising though, The Brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music!\\n \\n Best of the last 25 years? Maybe. Cunning to make the timescale not include Stairway to Heaven or Bohemian Rhapsody, but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really. Not much competition in the last 25 years after all.\\n \\n It\\'s alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years???\\n \\n There is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it\\'s a travesty.\\n \\n Rubbish! Who voted it for it to be included in any list? I am a regular listener to Radio 2 but I don\\'t recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn\\'t know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly NOT the best song of the last 25 years. How depressing and just when we thought manufactured \\'pop\\' was on the way out - where on earth did this dreadful list appear from?\\n \\n While I am biassed in that I thought Love Will Tear Us Apart should have won, in all seriousness, I think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty. Then again, well done Robbie, good show.\\n \\n You\\'ve got to be kidding.\\n \\n Angels is a great song, but not the best song of the last 25 years. Only the best song to be up for nomination at the Brits.\\n \\n I think Angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but I don\\'t think its the best song from the past 25 years! Right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was Will Young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn\\'t that good! I\\'m happy for Robbie himself though!\\n \\n Best song in the last 25 years? What a Joke! Think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than Angels. Phil Collins doesn\\'t deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote? Angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it. Soppy rubbish at best. Hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon, and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards.\\n \\n So boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in Britain today, for me it\\'s proof that music and democracy just don\\'t mix. Still, at least it wasn\\'t Will Young...\\n \\n Oh it\\'s all just a bit of fun. People take these awards too seriously! Robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non-fans know the words to angels. Him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards. Personally I wanted Will Young to win, but that was not really due to his musical talent!\\n \\n I hate the song, all it brings back is memories of school discos and no-one to slow-dance with!\\n \\n I agree about Angels. I never get fed up hearing it. Whenever the song comes on the radio I turn the radio up, smile and sing along (very badly, that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out). The song makes me calm and serene and happy. Well done Robbie.\\n \\n I think that although Robbie Williams is a good performer, that Angels isn\\'t really that good a song. It certainly isn\\'t anywhere near as good as Love Will Tear Us Apart by Joy Division or Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush.\\n \\n Angels is a fantastic song. All credit to Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers. It\\'s a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups.\\n \\n Robbie did in no way deserve that mantle. Whenever we have these awards it is always \\'artists\\' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...We forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example. They weren\\'t cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think.\\n \\n Yes Angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning.\\n \\n I\\'ve always disliked Angels intensely. I believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of British pre-teens, teens and middle aged women to accept low quality/ low aspirational music as \"classic\" songwriting. It\\'s \\'orrible. It seems obvious to me that people who like Robbie are people who don\\'t particularly like music all that much. Folks without collections; folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music. Angels adds nothing - it is merely an irritating distraction - a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer\\'s afternoon picnic. What a dreadful result. If you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don\\'t you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote. Booo hisss\\n \\n Angels, best song? You are kidding, right? Last five years I might be willing to accept, but 25, no way. Did whoever voted for this actually have ANY music knowledge prior to, say, 1995? Really quite insulting to the British music industry of the past quarter of a century.\\n \\n No surprise about Robbie Williams considering the list. Where on earth did the nominations list come from???? Compiled by an eleven year-old girl perhaps?? I mean, Will Young? Come on.\\n \\n What a load of crap, best song in the last 25 years - I don\\'t think so!! What about all the REAL artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless, but Robbie Williams doesn\\'t even come close.\\n \\n What a joke. That song has become such a bane to me that I have developed a Pavlovian response to the word \\'Angels\\' where I thrash around, and scream \"no no no no no\" until someone tells me \"the radio\\'s off\". Why a half-baked cheesy ditty like Angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on Pop Idol for example, and by whom), should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me. If this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up.\\n \\n Why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country?? The initial list was very weak anyway, but Angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!! I think not, I didn\\'t realize Radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10!!\\n \\n People have such short memories! A great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years? Not a chance. I think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.\\n \\n The Great British Public at work again. It\\'s a mediocre, sentimental and safe song. Granted, it\\'s not too bad, either. But can it stand up against ANYTHING by The Smiths (in particular \"How Soon is Now?\") or anything from the Stone Roses\\' first album? Nope.\\n \\n No, Because I\\'m not female and I\\'m not 10!\\n \\n Ok I like Robbie and Angels is a decent song. But it is no way the best song of the past 25 years! The shortlist wasn\\'t great but him winning it is a joke!\\n \\n Predictable and laughable.\\n \\n The success of Angels at this years Brits reflects poorly on the state of British music over the last 25 years. The British public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed. Whilst Angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in Robbie\\'s repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years.\\n \\n I am a huge Robbie fan and love that song. But I think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list.\\n \\n Have Radio 2 listeners even heard of Joy Division? A band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than Robbie Williams ever will.\\n \\n No doubt about it. There\\'s not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling. Some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but Angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.\\n \\n It should have been Joy Division.Those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while Angels remains yet another pop song. I sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now, the most influential artists will argue that Robbie Williams inspired their art in the way that the Byrds, the Beatles and Nick Drake have done for music today.\\n \\n Yes!! I think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people. There were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win! Robbie was a deserved winner.\\n \\n I am astounded that such a second-rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs! it\\'s a terrible song, voted for by the masses who don\\'t have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music.\\n \\n The best song of the past 25 years? Really? Come on, this is surely a joke? No? I think I need a long lie down...\\n \\n It just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick Robbie Williams over the beautifully talented Kate Bush and Joy Division. I suppose it\\'s confirmed one thing - the British public are consistently dull :- &lt;(\\n \\n No offence Robbie, but pleeease! There must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids. No one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of British music, and a further nail in the coffin!\\n \\n I think Robbie deserves it, he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in Britain since John Lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide. Anybody who says he doesn\\'t deserve it is jealous of his success. The only real challenger was Queen but hey, Another One Bites the Dust!!\\n \\n Obviously all the Karaoke singers in the UK voted for it.\\n \\n If this is the best song of the last 25 years then the British Music industry is in trouble. Sure Robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record.\\n \\n A sad day for music\\n \\n It\\'s not the type of music I normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, I recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people. That\\'s why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years. It\\'s a good all-rounder. Just like Robbie.\\n \\n Best song in 25 years? Since 1980? I\\'m confused. \"Angels\" isn\\'t a bad song. It\\'s a nice, catchy, formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes. But this is not great music. If anything it\\'s regressive. Bland even. I suppose it\\'s just more evidence of how redundant the Brit Awards have become.\\n \\n Granted angels is a good song, however it really wasn\\'t up against any other proper competition. The Queen\\'s song was lackluster, and apart from Kate Bush, the other choices were pathetic! Also, why weren\\'t the Stones there, David Bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than Angels...I wonder if it was simply the fact that Robbie wasn\\'t getting more awards so they had to make one up for him!\\n \\n Best song of the last 25 years? What a ridiculuous concept, and an even more ridiculous winner. Sigh. On the upside, at least it wasn\\'t Bohemian Rhapsody, for which we should all be thankful.\\n \\n Angels is without doubt a great song but I really don\\'t think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on Robbies\\' goodlooks than the actual song!!! Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m not disputing his looks, but there are more deserved winners.\\n \\n It would have been a travesty had Angels not won. Without Angels, Robbie Williams may well not be where he is now, and Britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists. It has to be seen performed live, with 125,000 people singing along to be fully appreciated. Well done Rob.\\n \\n I find it hard to believe that \\'Angels\\' is the best we have to show for the past 25 years! I\\'m rapidly redifining \\'best\\' in my own head now to mean \\'most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning\\'. What about Britpop? Blur, Oasis, Suede, Pulp... not only making fantastic songs but also making changes, doing something different. Why must \\'best\\' always come down to most commercially popular?\\n \\n I\\'ve nothing against Robbie, I actually like his music, but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year? The Brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales. The same goes with the Scissor Sisters, I think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award, but the album comes no where near U2\\'s new record, neither are they in the same league. Once again there have been some baffling discisions made, they are not for artisic reasons, but for profit.\\n \\n No surprise really, it\\'s voted for by the general public. Since when did they have taste in music?\\n \\n Personally I find Angels by Robbie Williams to be one of the most irritating songs I have ever heard!\\n \\n It absolutely deserved to win. It is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.\\n \\n It\\'s an absolute joke, however most of the original 25 were very poor choices as well. All in all a pretty pointless exercise !\\n \\n The song is overplayed and oversentimental. Out of the rather poor five choices that were left, it should have gone to either Joy Division or Queen. I suppose we should be thankful that it didn\\'t end up in the hands of Will Young though.\\n \\n Although it has nostalgia value, there is no way it deserved to win. Everybody knows the words to Bohemian Rhapsody, Nothing Compares 2 U, etc. Much better songs and more timeless. Give it to someone with real talent.\\n \\n Although Angels is a good song I think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years. This is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye. Why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that\\'s all it means!\\n',\n",
       " 'Jamelia\\'s return to the top\\n \\n R&B star Jamelia had three Brit nominations to go with her triple triumph at last year\\'s Mobo awards.\\n \\n The Birmingham-born singer, full name Jamelia Davis, was signed to a record label at the age of 15 and released her first single So High at 18. She released four number ones from her 2000 album Drama, including the top five hit Money featuring the vocals of reggae artist Beenie Man. She racked up five Mobo nominations in 2000, winning one for best video. But in the same year she also fell pregnant and decided to take a break from music to bring up her daughter Teja, who was born in March 2001. While she originally planned to get back to work pretty swiftly after giving birth it was actually two years before she released another single. During her absence R&B music exploded and a whole host of female artists were on the scene, meaning Jamelia had to once again prove herself. Her comeback song Bout featuring Rah Digga only just scrapped into the top 40.\\n \\n It was her next single, Superstar, that really put her back on the map as one of Britain\\'s most popular female R&B singers, holding her own in a music scene dominated by US artists such as Beyonce and Ashanti.\\n \\n Superstar was followed by Thank You, winner of best single at the 2004 Mobos, which reached number two in the UK charts. The autobiographical song, which deals with domestic abuse, hit number one in New Zealand and Australia. Next came the song See It In A Boy\\'s Eyes, which was especially written for her by Coldplay\\'s Chris Martin. His involvement with the song meant not only was it given massive publicity but it was also greeted favourably by a new audience who would not usually listen to R&B. She now combines singing with modelling and supporting charities including the NSPCC and Make Trade Fair. Despite her huge success in recent years, Jamelia remains down-to-earth about her fame and her chances of lasting in the fickle music business, partly due to motherhood. \"When I first got into the industry, I\\'d be away from home for months at a time. But now I have other things in my life. I still want to make it, but it\\'s not the end of the world if I don\\'t,\" commented Jamelia.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cult band Kasabian surge forward\\n \\n Indie dance band Kasabian built up a cult following throughout 2004 to secure three Brit Award nominations.\\n \\n The four-piece Leicester band blends dark electronics with rock, earning Kasabian places on the best British group, rock act and live act shortlists. They have also earned a reputation as outspoken and charismatic, in contrast to fellow Brit nominees such as Keane and Snow Patrol. \"British music needs a kick up the arse and Britain needs a new band to breathe life into the British people again,\" declared Kasabian\\'s singer Tom Meighan.\\n \\n \"No-one\\'s doing it at the minute. Music feels like it\\'s in the afterlife right now. We don\\'t want people to give up on it. \"The serpent\\'s going to rise from the sea and scare all the pirates away!\" Meighan grew up in Leicester with Kasabian songwriter/guitarist Sergio Pizzorno and bassist Chris Edwards, a trio which began making music from the age of 17.\\n \\n They enlisted guitarist and keyboard player Christopher Karloff after spotting him in a pub. \"We saw his long sideburns and thought \\'hey, he looks the part, we\\'ll ask him,\\'\" said Meighan. Inspired by Britpop and a mutual love of hardcore, an early 1990s genre that fused house music with hip hop beats and a dark sensibility, they added an electronic element to the traditional guitar sound. \"We got a computer and we cut rock\\'n\\'roll up, because there\\'s no point in going back to how it was,\" said Meighan. \"It\\'s all about new ideas and creativity.\"\\n \\n The band\\'s original approach is reflected in its name, inspired by Linda Kasabian - the getaway driver of US serial killer Charles Manson. Coincidentally it is also the Armenian term for \"butcher\". Kasabian moved into a remote farmhouse in Rutland to record their debut album, benefiting from its isolation but also managing to sneak in a few parties while they were there. Signed to the RCA record label, Kasabian tested the water with two singles, Club Foot and LSF, which reached numbers 19 and 10 in the UK singles chart respectively.\\n \\n They built up their following on the summer festival circuit, opening both Glastonbury and T in the Park, and at a series of \"guerilla gigs\" at unusual venues including Half Time Orange, a pub next to Leicester City football club\\'s headquarters. Kasabian\\'s self-titled album was released last September to widespread critical acclaim, its indie dance stance drawing comparisons to The Stone Roses, Primal Scream and The Happy Mondays.\\n \\n Regarding it as \"both a fiery assertion of rock \\'n\\' roll ethics and proof that a siege mentality is alive and well in the badlands of Rutland Water\", the NME\\'s praise was typical of the album\\'s reception. As 2004 progressed Kasabian would score a further two hits - Processed Beats and Cutt Off - and embark upon a well-received UK tour. \"We take our music seriously, definitely, but we want to have fun with it,\" said Pizzorno. \"This is not a job to us,\" added Meighan. \"This is the best life we could ever have. This is what it\\'s all about and without it we\\'d be lost souls. But music needs us as well.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Brits debate over \\'urban\\' music\\n \\n Joss Stone, a 17-year-old soul singer from Devon, beat Dizzee Rascal, Jamelia, Lemar and The Streets to win best British urban act at the Brit Awards. Her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n I\\'m not really comfortable with the word urban. It\\'s a word that\\'s been manufactured in this country and America to describe black music. The word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it\\'s wrong. How far are the Brits removed from inner-city music and what people are doing? It\\'s so far removed that I don\\'t expect them to get it bang on. The music industry isn\\'t championing music from our particular genre very well anyway. People don\\'t feel like that\\'s anything to do with us. I don\\'t feel like urban music\\'s just been celebrated by [Joss Stone] winning or her being nominated, or by the Brits acknowledging that there\\'s an urban music scene because it\\'s all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day. It\\'s not really relevant. If Joss Stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who she\\'s signed to, then so be it. It\\'s got nothing to do with what\\'s really going on.\\n \\n \\n \\n Urban as a genre is very broad. If you look underneath urban, there are a number of core elements that include hip-hop, R&B, garage and into that obviously comes soul. Joss Stone is a soul artist. Her first album was called The Soul Sessions. So urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub-genres, and there are offshoots of all of those. Joss Stone has had amazing success [in the US] given that she\\'s a UK artist. What has really captured everybody\\'s imagination is that here you have a 17-year-old from Devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really, really good tunes and she looks good - I think that\\'s what\\'s done it.\\n \\n The award for best British urban act was voted for by viewers of MTV Base.\\n \\n \\n \\n I don\\'t think Joss was not a worthy winner. She makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban. The fact that she\\'s from Devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and she\\'s literally rural. The great thing about urban music is that there\\'s a big range. If there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in Britain, I think that\\'s where you can call it urban - that\\'s where this new sub-category, or uber-category, has come from. Joss Stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer, but you couldn\\'t argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions - it is coming from somewhere genuine. It has to come across as real. That\\'s the only cut-off point we have here and that\\'s the only way by which we judge people.\\n \\n \\n \\n What urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background. Music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi-cultural Britain, then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion. If Joss Stone can be accepted within the urban music community, I think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too. Race doesn\\'t make a difference if everyone is included. Out of all the awards dished out yesterday, I\\'m still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award.\\n \\n \\n \\n A type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city, and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life.\\n \\n She might not be urban, but when did R&B become the hip hop tainted thing it is now? R&B stands for Rhythm And Blues, remember!\\n \\n That Joss Stone is rubbish is certain. If anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (I think probably should include Hip-Hop, Soul & Funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the Streets, although Dizzee Rascal stakes a good claim\\n \\n She definitely deserved to win a prize, Joss Stone\\'s albums are quite simply amazing, easily better than anything else that was released last year. This whole debate about what is urban, what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who weren\\'t nominated or didn\\'t win. I cant see why people can\\'t just congratulate her for the talent that she is.\\n \\n She did deserve it, but I agree with the comments about urban music. Its a stupid phrase, and particularly British. In the states they tend to use hip hop and R&B, if I say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what I\\'m talking about. Very strange.\\n \\n What\\'s in a name? A rose by any other name etc... If people want to call it urban, why not? If we really analysed it, the term \\'dance music\\' is misleading because it doesn\\'t describe everything you can dance to.\\n \\n Whilst I agree that the term \\'urban\\' is open to interpretation, it strikes me as simply weird that Joss Stone has won. \\'Urban\\' to me is what I hear being played in parties in the inner cities - I live in Brixton and have never heard The Soul Sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties I\\'ve been to. Good luck to Joss Stone, let\\'s celebrate her victory - let\\'s also question why, with artists so successful and talented as Jamelia, Lemar, Kanye West, Dizzee Rascal, Alicia Keys and Outkast - we didn\\'t see a single black artist on stage collecting an award.\\n \\n So, what you\\'re saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isn\\'t black. And, if it is, then they shouldn\\'t be acknowledged for it even if they\\'re pretty dam good at it? She\\'s 17, has an amazing voice, and won. Good on her. Oh, but she\\'s not \"black\" well, let\\'s make her feel real bad about it then. How dare she! Though hang on, didn\\'t the so-called \\'public\\' vote on this one?\\n \\n This idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what \"Jazz\" was. The media then called anything that had a swinging beat, syncopated melody or soulful feeling \"Jazz\", much to the chagrin of the artists. It would mean that \"blues\" would be put in the same mould as \"bebop\", \"cool\" and \"ragtime\", all very different styles at that time. Jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term. And so what of \"Urban\" music? In truth it\\'s a lazy term to categorise music that you don\\'t really understand. Soul and garage are worlds apart musically (Marvin Gaye v Tuff Jam?), but no doubt have their connections. If we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won, then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is, rather than what it represents.\\n \\n I demand a prize for rural music! Sucks to the cities- it\\'s way better out here. We have hay, for one thing.\\n \\n Excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding Lenny Kravitz or Hendrix from rock music for being black surely? I dont understand the point that Ty is making. If Lemar, who makes music which is less soulful than Joss\\' work won, he might have said nothing. (btw i\\'m black too)\\n \\n How can she be \"urban\" if she spent most of her life in the Devon countryside? Nonsense.\\n \\n I love Joss to bits and don\\'t care what her branding is - it\\'s amazing music, full stop. Stop puting it all in brackets and let\\'s just call it music, and let\\'s especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin, this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.\\n \\n Surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is (historically) considered urban music, irrelevent of the colour of their skin, or where they originate from. Joss Stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style, just as someone from an inner city, and indeed not from the USA could sing country music. If that person was good at it and authentic in sound, would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style?\\n \\n The term urban in reference to a music genre in UK has developed, in part, from the controversy surrounding the branding of the MOBO Awards. The very term \\'Music of Black Origin\\' has confused and offended many people. This is particularly strange given the existence of the Asian Music Awards. It appears that the use of \\'black\\' or \\'white\\' in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable. The term \\'urban\\' therefore, has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first \\'black\\' or \\'white\\' thereby rendering the issue colourblind. The result is now a redundant new debate as to what \\'urban\\' also means. Perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul/RnB and Hip-Hop, one which does not also mean something else - as we have done with \\'Crunk\\'.\\n \\n Urban is just a word that\\'s come about recently to describe \"black\" music that\\'s become popular now. The word wasn\\'t even in use, or common use five of six years ago. It\\'s just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music, because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it.\\n \\n I\\'m in a band that has been called \"urban\", and I despise the label. I\\'d hate to think I belonged to any neat marketing niche, because that\\'s all it is. Ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider \\'music of black origin\\', these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity. Look at all the TV broadcasters, unable to reach young people without condesending, they simply play some \\'urban\\' music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music. Ignore the labels, it is what it is, just music.\\n \\n As a black man, I think I agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives. Black people should lead the music they invented . We should stop calling a genre meaningless, northing is meaningless. The real question is would Joss Stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black? Same thing, with Streets, Amy Winehouse, etc. Who\\'s ever heard of Terri Walker or Rhian Benson.. They are both 10 times better than Joss Stone and both of them have won Urban Music Awards and i think Mobos , but why not Brits????\\n \\n So what if Joss Stone won the Urban awards. Her music is great soul and surely that is under the \\'Urban\\' banner? What if The Streets had won? Would people be whining because Mike Skinner is white... It seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else.\\n \\n Urban is PC version for saying black music. I\\'m not doubting Ms Stone\\'s talent, but why didn\\'t Jamelia or Lemar get a Brit? This reminds me of what happened to Craig David and Soul II Soul in the past, getting nominations are easy to get, but picking up a Brit seems to be the hardest thing.\\n \\n Refreshing to see people making reasonable, intelligent comments on any topic these days. More power to you, people! You have said it: there is music you like and music you don\\'t like - who cares what label you put on it?\\n \\n That entire category was a mess. How can you have people like Dizzee Rascal up against Joss Stone? Its like putting Eminem against Bob Geldof. She should have been nominated for Best British R & B act. Joss Stone deserved to win an award for her talents, but I don\\'t think it was very \\'urban\\' of her to sing angels with Robbie Williams.\\n \\n Urban is a nonsense term - music of black origin? Well doesn\\'t that include rock? Music made in the inner cities? Well almost all bands end up making music in London/Manchester etc. And doesn\\'t that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities? It doesn\\'t make any sense.\\n \\n Why does music have to be put into a genre? It\\'s music, you like it or you don\\'t. Simple as that.\\n \\n I play in a heavy metal band. We are urban music as far as I\\'m concerned. We live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment; It therefore directly shapes what we write musically.\\n \\n \"Urban\" seems to be the new name for all styles of black music. Why it needed a rebrand I don\\'t know as the name is misleading. Oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know, therefore more than fit the term \"urban\" yet as they\\'re a white rock band they won\\'t be described as such.\\n \\n Joss Stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery - what other reason do they need to award her the Brit? All this \"urban\" and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored.\\n \\n Yeah, she deserved it. She is talented. Urban is a crap, meaningless, politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though. There\\'s only two kinds of music: good and bad.\\n',\n",
       " 'Row threatens Hendrix museum plan\\n \\n Proposals to open a museum dedicated to Jimi Hendrix are flailing because of a row over the home of his late father.\\n \\n The run-down house in Seattle has already been moved wholesale once and local authorities are now demanding it be moved to another site. Hendrix supporters hoped to turn the home into a museum for the guitarist. \"The mayor is going to go down as the mayor who destroyed Jimi Hendrix\\'s house,\" said Ray Rae Marshall of the James Marshall Hendrix Foundation. The foundation moved the building, in which Al Hendrix lived between 1953 and 1956, when the land it was built on was to be developed for housing in 2002. Now the City of Seattle wants its new plot to be used for development, giving a deadline of 22 February for the home to be moved. Mr Goldman said the authority had promised the house could remain on its new site and be turned into a memorial and community centre. Seattle officials said no such deal had been offered.\\n \\n \"We never said, \\'You can own this property,\\'\" said John Franklin, chief of its operations department. \"From our perspective, it was a temporary situation. We have not threatened to demolish the house. We\\'ve simply asked that they have to move it.\" Now Mr Goldman is calling for the authority to pay to move the building to Seattle\\'s central district, where Hendrix grew up. Janie Hendrix, the guitarist\\'s stepsister, said the family were still hoping the guitarist would be honoured by having a road named after him. \"That\\'s something my father really wanted to see,\" she said. \"It would be nice if we didn\\'t have to fight for everything to get it.\" Hendrix was widely considered one of the most important guitarists of his time. He died of drug overdose in 1970 at the age of 27.\\n',\n",
       " 'No jail for singer Courtney Love\\n \\n Singer Courtney Love has been spared jail for assault and drug offences, but must serve three years probation.\\n \\n She had back-to-back court appearances in two separate cases in Los Angeles, first pleading no contest to attacking a woman with a whisky bottle. In the second, Ms Love, 40, pleaded guilty to possessing a forged prescription and painkiller oxycodone. She must also do 100 hours community service, have drug treatment, attend Narcotics Anonymous and pay a fine. The ex-Hole singer\\'s lawyer Howard Weitzman said Ms Love had \"turned her life around\" and she was \"clean and sober\".\\n \\n The assault charge stemmed from April 2004, when Ms Love found musician Kristin King in her boyfriend\\'s home. Ms King said the singer \"threw the bottle at the left side of my face\" in an \"angry, vicious and erratic\" attack. Ms Love was originally charged with the more serious offence of assault with a deadly weapon, but that was reduced to assault. Judge Rand Rubin said she must:\\n \\n - Spend three years on probation \\n  - Have one year\\'s anger management counselling \\n  - Have one year\\'s drug rehabilitation \\n  - Do 100 hours community service \\n  - Pay $1,000 (Â£535) fine \\n  - Have random drug tests \\n  - Go to three Narcotics Anonymous meetings per week\\n \\n In the drugs case, she was sentenced to 18 months probation, to run concurrently with the probation for the assault. That offence stemmed from October 2003, when she suffered an overdose after breaking a window at her boyfriend\\'s home. In a separate case relating to the same incident, Ms Love was sentenced to 18 months in drug rehabilitation for being under the influence of cocaine and opiates. In another case last October, she pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for hitting a man on the head with a microphone stand at a New York City nightclub. Last month her lawyers said she had won back custody of Frances Bean, her 12-year-old daughter with former Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. The girl was removed from her care following her double arrest in October 2003. Cobain committed suicide in 1994.\\n',\n",
       " 'Rapper Kanye West\\'s shrewd soul\\n \\n US hip-hop star Kanye West - who leads the race for this year\\'s Grammys with 10 nominations - rose to prominence by producing songs for artists such as Jay-Z and Alicia Keys.\\n \\n He then emerged from his behind-the-scenes role to become an artist as well as a producer. But his solo career almost ended before it began after a near-fatal car crash left West with his jaw wired shut in 2002. The resulting song, Through the Wire, became West\\'s first UK hit in April 2004 and subsequent album The College Dropout became a transatlantic success, both critically and commercially. West, 26, began rapping as a teenager at his Chicago school, inspired by the beats and rhymes of 1980s pioneers Run DMC.\\n \\n Hip-hop producer No ID encouraged West to sample old soul and R&B hits then revive them with an updated sound, an approach that would become his trademark. \"I feel like a lot of the soul that\\'s in those old records that I sample is in me,\" he said. \"So when I hear them and I put them with the drums and I bring them to the new millennium, it\\'s just like God\\'s doing that. I\\'m one with them records right there. It\\'s a blessing.\"\\n \\n Leaving his Chicago art school after only one year - a move which would later inspire the title of his album - West began his music career co-producing songs for artists Mase and the Madd Rapper. This drew the attention of superstar rapper Jay-Z, who signed West up to his Roc-A-Fella record label to produce numerous artists on his roster. West\\'s work gained mainstream recognition when he produced the singles Takeover and Izzo (HOVA) on Jay-Z\\'s own 2001 album Blueprint. Incorporating samples of Five to One by The Doors and the Jackson Five\\'s I Want You Back respectively, the hits were credited with injecting soul back into hip-hop.\\n \\n As their success attracted further production work for Jay-Z (\\'03 Bonnie & Clyde) and artists such as Ludacris (Stand Up) and Alicia Keys (You Don\\'t Know My Name), West announced plans for a solo album. Driving home from a late-night Los Angeles recording session in October 2002, he was involved in the car crash that left his jaw fractured in three places. \"Anytime I hear about any accident my heart sinks in and I just thank God that I\\'m still here,\" he later said. \"That steering wheel could have been two inches further out, and that would have been it.\"\\n \\n West\\'s account of the accident sampled Chaka Khan\\'s hit Through the Fire to become the heart of his completed solo album The College Dropout. Released last year, it was by turns smooth, humorous and sharp and largely avoided the clich&#233;d hip-hop preoccupation with guns, girls and jewellery.\\n \\n Through the Wire was quickly joined in the UK and US charts by Slow Jamz, on which West collaborated with rapper Twista and Ray actor Jamie Foxx. The College Dropout spawned two further UK hits and a string of award nominations. West was shortlisted for 10 Grammys - including nominations for artist and album of the year - and took the best hip-hop artist, producer and album titles at last year\\'s Music of Black Origin (Mobo) Awards. Now a respected rapper and producer in the influential field of hip-hop, Kanye West is unlikely to regret his decision to leave college early.\\n',\n",

The pair have been together for more than two years. \"No wedding plans have been set yet,\" said Aguilera\\'s agent Meghan Prophet. Aguilera burst onto the pop scene in 1999, winning a best new artist Grammy in 2000. Her hits include What a Girl Wants, Dirrty and Beautiful. Bratman presented his fiancee with a diamond ring designed by jeweller Stephen Webster on Friday, said Ms Prophet. New York-born Aguilera reached number one in the UK with her debut hit Genie in a Bottle in October 1999. Her early success was cemented by two further Grammys in subsequent years. In 2002, Aguilera won best pop collaboration for the hit track Lady Marmalade with Lil\\' Kim, Maya and Pink, and last year she picked up the award for best female pop vocal performance for Beautiful. Her most recent single, Car Wash, featuring Missy Elliott, reached number four in the UK charts last November.\\n',\n",

Also capitalising on Brits success were the Scissor Sisters whose eponymous album moved three places to number two. U2's latest single Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own took the top spot in the singles chart, ahead of Elvis. The track, from their current album How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, pushed Eminem's Like Toy Soldiers from number one to number three.\\n \\n Elvis' Wooden Heart, which entered the chart at number two, is the sixth in a series of 18 reissues to mark the 70th anniversary of Presley's birth. There are currently six re-released Elvis' tracks occupying spots in the top 40 singles chart including Are You Lonesome Tonight at number 20, It's Now or Never at number 27 and Jailhouse Rock at number 37. Soldier, by Destiny's Child, Ti and Lil Wayne, debuted at number four, while Almost Here, the duet from former Westlife star Brian McFadden and Delta Goodrem, fell from number three to number five.

       " 'U2\\'s desire to be number one\\n \\n U2, who have won three prestigious Grammy Awards for their hit Vertigo, are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world.\\n \\n The most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common. The music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive, if not always groundbreaking. But such success is down to more than music. They have to be compelling performers, charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground. They also have to want it. They have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it. The Beatles had it, the Rolling Stones still have it, REM hold onto it and Queen were it in a catsuit. And U2 have it in spades, and keep churning it out. Their new album, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in Dublin and 17 years after The Joshua Tree cemented their place on the all-time rock A-list.\\n \\n They may have lost some of the edginess and raw, youthful force that propelled them to the top, but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums.\\n \\n Vertigo, the first single from the new album, went straight into the UK singles chart at number one, knocking Eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit. \"The challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make records the whole world will listen to,\" Bono recently said. Drummer Larry Mullen Jr echoed those sentiments: \"We\\'re very competitive - we want to be on the radio, have big singles. We don\\'t want to be thought of as a veteran band.\" The band have done \"everything in their considerable powers\" to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world, according to Q magazine editor Paul Rees.\\n \\n \"This makes them hugely determined and formidable.\" He added: \"They are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up. \"As such, they\\'ve constantly re-invented and challenged themselves. They are, perhaps, alone as the only rock band that has got better with age.\" The other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised, Mr Rees said. \"They do everything in the right way.\" The group were born when Mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board, attracting fellow pupils Paul Hewson (Bono, vocals), Adam Clayton (bass), David Evans (The Edge, guitar) and his brother Dick.\\n \\n Dick Evans soon dropped out and the four-piece were known as The Feedback and The Hype before settling on U2.\\n \\n By 1978, they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager, Paul McGuinness. \"They were brilliant, but very coarse,\" McGuinness recently said. \"In a way, they were doing exactly what they do now. Only badly.\" They struggled to attract record company attention, later being described as \"pretty damn average\" and \"strange and eerie\" by scouts who saw them live. They released two Ireland-only singles, which topped the national charts in 1979 and 1980, leading to a deal with Island and their debut album Boy. The stadium-filling, anthemic sound was U2\\'s aim from the start, and their third album, War, saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the Atlantic, going to number one in the UK and 12 in the US. Songs like Sunday Bloody Sunday and New Year\\'s Day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which Bono rejected as a cliche.\\n \\n His stage performances - which included flag-waving, speaker-climbing and drum-throwing - earned him a reputation as an electric performer, and their appearance at 1985\\'s Live Aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom.\\n \\n In 1987, The Joshua Tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including Where the Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven\\'t Found What I\\'m Looking For and With Or Without You. Those songs took the band\\'s epic, atmospheric sound to a simple, powerful and popular pinnacle. The end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements. These came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music, plus wildly extravagant stage shows, while still trying to retain their mass appeal. The Achtung Baby album in 1991 was followed by Zooropa, Pop and their corresponding stadium tours, which featured giant olives, flying cars, live phone calls to the White House and Bono\\'s transformation into alter-egos The Fly and MacPhisto. He was also building a parallel reputation - not always to the pleasure of his bandmates - as a campaigner on issues from global debt to Aids. Before the release of How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, they had sold 125 million albums around the world. But they still want more.\\n',\n",
       " 'Lasting influence of legend Charles\\n \\n Ray Charles, who has won a string of posthumous Grammy Awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.\\n \\n His sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock \\'n\\' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent UK beat and R&B scenes.\\n \\n Compared in stature to Elvis Presley by some commentators, Charles\\' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison. His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the \"devil\\'s\" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.\\n \\n Without Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett. He was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock \\'n\\' roll greats, including I\\'ve Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What\\'d I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael\\'s sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack.\\n \\n He also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of Hank Williams standards such as Your Cheating Heart and You Win Again. More than 40 years after its release, his 1962 ABC album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is still regarded as a classic. His version of Don Gibson\\'s I Can\\'t Stop Loving You topped the pop and R&B charts in the US. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People.\\n \\n On it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a \"brother in every sense of the word\". \"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did,\" he said. Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes. \"I\\'m quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,\" he told BBC News Online. \"I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Grammys honour soul star Charles\\n \\n The memory of soul legend Ray Charles dominated the music world\\'s leading music ceremony on Sunday as he was given eight posthumous Grammy Awards.\\n \\n Charles, who died in 2004, got honours including record and album of the year, while Alicia Keys and actor Jamie Foxx performed a musical tribute to him. R&B star Keys won four awards herself at the Grammy ceremony in Los Angeles. U2, Usher, Norah Jones and Kanye West got three each. West led the race going into the ceremony with 10 nominations.\\n \\n Charles\\' last album, Genius Loves Company, a collection of duets that has sold more than two million copies, was named album of the year and best pop vocal album. His song Here We Go Again with Norah Jones won record of the year and best pop vocal collaboration, while Heaven Help Us All with Gladys Knight picked up best gospel performance. Jones said: \"I\\'m glad he\\'s getting recognised, because of who he is and how much I love him.\" Actor Jamie Foxx - who is nominated for an Oscar for playing Charles in the hit movie Ray - dedicated a rendition of Georgia on My Mind to \"old friends\". Keys, looking to replicate her Grammys success of 2002, when she won five, picked up best R&B song for You Don\\'t Know My Name and best R&B album for The Diary of Alicia Keys. She also shared the award for best R&B vocal performance by a duo or group with Usher for My Boo.\\n \\n Usher\\'s other victories were for best contemporary R&B album for Confessions and best rap/sung collaboration for Yeah!, featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris. Kanye West dominated the rap categories, winning best rap song for Jesus Walks and best rap album for The College Dropout. But in one of the night\\'s biggest shocks, he lost out in the battle to be named best new artist to pop rock act Maroon 5. Vertigo by rock giants U2 won three trophies - best rock song, best short video and best rock vocal performance by a duo or group. One of the other main awards, song of the year, went to US singer-songwriter John Mayer for Daughters. Mayer also won best male pop vocal performance. Britney Spears picked up her first ever Grammy for her song Toxic, which was named best dance recording.\\n \\n Rod Stewart also won the first Grammy of his career, getting the best traditional pop album award for Stardust... The Great American Songbook: Volume III. In 2003, Stewart said he was \"astounded\" he had never won a Grammy - but \"they tend not to give it to the British unless you\\'re Sting\". There were few other high-profile British victors this year. Annie Lennox, metal group Motorhead and dance act Basement Jaxx all took home trophies. But Elvis Costello, who had four nominations, and Joss Stone and Franz Ferdinand, who were both up for three awards, got nothing.\\n \\n Beach Boys veteran Brian Wilson was another first-time winner - for best rock instrumental performance. \"It represents triumph and achievement in music that I feel that I deserved, and I\\'m really glad I won,\" he said. A live recording of composer John Adams\\' 11 September tribute, On the Transmigration of Souls, performed by the New York Philharmonic, won three classical prizes. And former US President Bill Clinton picked up the second Grammy of his career, winning the spoken word award for the audio version of his autobiography My Life.\\n',\n",

Faltskog has been a virtual recluse since the band split up in 1982. The musical, which has become a global phenomenon, will be performed in Swedish for the first time. Fans camped outside Stockholm's Cirkus theatre in the snow for a glimpse of the stars. The premiere marks Abba's first public reunion since the legendary band's acrimonious break-up in the early 1980s. It was thought that Faltskog would appear in London for the musical's fifth anniversary celebrations in April 2004 but she stayed away due to her fear of flying.\\n \\n Original Abba member Bjorn Ulvaeus set about translating the musical into the band's mother tongue for the celebrated homecoming, alongside Swedish artist Niklas Stromstedt. Almost all of Abba's original songs, which have sold more than 350 million records worldwide, were written and recorded in English. The musical, set on a small Greek island, tells of the story of a young woman and her fiercely independent single mother. The show will include such classics as Super Trouper, SOS and Dancing Queen. There are currently 14 productions being staged worldwide, including New York and London, with road shows in Toronto, South Korea and Madrid. More than 20 million people around the world have seen the show.\\n\",\n",

Downloaded singles have now overtaken physical singles in the UK. Mr Jamieson said his organisation was lobbying music service providers, which include iTunes and Napster, to urge them to promote independent releases. Download sales are due to be incorporated into the UK singles chart later this year. \"With downloads shortly to be eligible for the singles chart, this is a key commercial issue on which the BPI committed to assisting its members,\" added Mr Jamieson. As part of the campaign the BPI is running a series of seminars entitled Getting Your Music Online, focusing on how independent labels can embrace digital music. The US has already begun incorporating download sales in the Billboard\\'s Hot 100 chart.\\n',\n",

Green Day, the Foo Fighters and Keane are among the acts that had already been lined up to appear at the event. However, the organisers have revealed Scots favourites Travis as well as soulman James Brown will also appear.\\n \\n Last year tickets sold out 10 weeks before the festival but organisers confirmed that all 130,000 for the two-day event had been sold. Geoff Ellis, CEO of festival organisers Big Day Out Ltd, said this year\\'s event promises to be the best yet. \"After last year\\'s sell-out, we did think this year\\'s event would sell slightly earlier, however this is way beyond our expectations,\" Mr Ellis said.\\n \\n \"We are extremely proud that fans are so excited about T in the Park that they have made absolutely sure that their place at Balado is booked for 2005, and we will deliver one of the greatest events yet for them in July.\" More than 120 acts will play on eight stages over the weekend of 9 and 10 July. Brit Award winners Keane and The Streets are among the main attractions, while The Killers and dance act The Prodigy are also on the bill. Both Green Day and The Foo Fighters last played at the festival in 2002, the same year Oasis and Basement Jaxx were among the headline acts.\\n',\n",

The band have three more efforts on the list, including fifth-placed Paranoid. Osbourne appears more than any other act, with two solo records featured. The top five includes Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden and Sex Pistols. Queen, Muse, Manic Street Preachers and The Clash complete the top 10. A mix of heavy metal, punk, glam rock and even dance music makes up the list. Motorhead, Judas Priest and Prodigy are included along with newer acts like The Darkness and Lostprophets.\\n \\n Kerrang! editor Ashley Bird said: \"It\\'s amazing to see so many incredible homegrown albums in one list, and without any of the abysmal fashion bands that currently clog up the music scene. \"These are the real opinions of proper rock fans.\"\\n \\n Formed by four teenage friends in the West Midlands in the late 1960s, Black Sabbath are one of Britain\\'s most successful heavy rock bands. Their debut was a UK top 10 hit in 1970 and sold more than a million copies in the US. Osbourne said the band\\'s success in the Kerrang! poll was a triumph for British rock. He said: \"Back then you\\'d hear: \\'If you go to San Francisco, be sure to wear a flower in your hair\\'. \"We lived in Aston, Birmingham. The only flowers I ever saw were on a gravestone in our local cemetery.\" Despite being disliked by many critics, Black Sabbath\\'s subsequent albums included multi-million sellers but internal rows led to Osbourne leaving in 1979. The band continued without Osbourne, who went on to solo success but also had to battle alcoholism and legal action over his music allegedly inciting teenagers to commit suicide. He was eventually cleared of the charges. Osbourne, who bit off the head of a live bat on stage in 1982, rejoined the band to play the Live Aid charity concert in 1985. After many changes in line-up, the original four members reunited to play live dates in 1997. Black Sabbath have reunited regularly in recent years while Osbourne has gone on to wider fame with his family through MTV documentary series The Osbournes.\\n',\n",

The film, A Different Story, chronicles Michael\\'s life and career from the 1980s and his personal struggles. The 41-year-old chart-topper told reporters in the German capital that he wanted to \"move his career into a different form\", but added that he does not know what it is going to be yet.\\n \\n \"I\\'m still going to be making music,\" he said, but added that he was \"not going to be around\". He hinted at discontent with the current state of music industry, and said: \"I don\\'t really think that there is anyone in the modern pop business who I feel I want to spar with.\" Michael said that the film, directed by Southan Morris, would put his two decades of fame into context. \"It\\'s almost as much for me as for my fans, in terms of trying to make sense of the last 22 years and bring it to a close in a proper way,\" he said. The documentary chronicles the highs and lows of his life in the public gaze, from his meteoric rise as one half of pop duo Wham! to his arrest for lewd conduct in a Los Angeles toilet in 1998. The film also deals with the loss of Michael\\'s partner Anselmo Feleppa from an Aids-related condition in 1993.

The vast archive of instruments, signed records and posters were collected by a dedicated fan who had become friendly with the star. The auction was billed as the biggest collection of Hendrix memorabilia to go under the hammer. The majority of the items were collected by fan Bob Terry who began collecting at the age of 17. He later sold it on to another collector.\\n \\n Hendrix, widely considered one of the best guitarists of his era, died of a drug overdose in 1970 at the age of 27.

       " 'German music in a \\'zombie\\' state\\n \\n The German music business - the third largest in the world - is \"in the state of a zombie\" because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy, a leading industry figure has said.\\n \\n Tim Renner, the head of Universal Music Germany until last year, told BBC World Service\\'s The Music Biz programme that the country\\'s music industry was now struggling to survive. Renner warned that unless the industry accepted \"new realties\" - such as downloading - its decline could become irreversible. \"The problem the music industry has got is that they aren\\'t willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out,\" he stated. \"So the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie.\"\\n \\n The music market in Germany peaked in 1997, with sales of 2.6bn euros (Â£1.8bn). Since 2000, sales have plummeted to just 1.6bn euros (Â£1.1bn) in 2003. In the space of one year - between 2002 and 2003 - CD album sales fell by 13.8%. But a study by the Society for Consumer Research found that at the same time, more than twice as many recordable CDs had music recorded on them than CD albums were sold. Mr Renner pointed out that, because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a good-selling record, this was particularly damaging.\\n \\n \"You need time,\" he added. However, Peter Zombic, the managing director of the International Federation of Phonographic Industry in Germany, said he did not feel the situation was as \"dramatic\" as Mr Renner believed. \"It\\'s quite true that we have severe problems in Germany - but that\\'s true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too,\" he argued. \"We have a severe problem with piracy, especially internet piracy, and we also have a severe problem of private copying. \"I don\\'t agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact, especially in regard to Germany talent, the market is quite successful.\" He did, however, admit that copyright owners have \"partly lost control of their copyright\", due to piracy and copying.\\n \\n But he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading. \"We were the first to implement a download service - back in 1997,\" he argued. \"At that time it was not successful, because of the advent of piracy - it was the Napster time, when P2P services became popular. \"It still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned.\" Mr Zombic also called for a change to the perception in Germany that private copying of music is not a problem. German law does allow people to make copies of CDs for their family and close friends, without fear of breaking copyright. Mr Zombic said that this legal framework was a \"huge problem\". \"There is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby, it\\'s nice, it\\'s fun,\" he added. \"We try to make clear it\\'s not nice and it\\'s not fun - it\\'s endangering the creativity in our country.\"\\n',\n",

The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on Â£50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\\n \\n Babyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines\\' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There\\'s a few people getting hurt down the front, you\\'ve got to move back.\"\\n \\n The music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden\\'s guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches.

Julie Andrews starred in the 1965 film version of the Rogers and Hammerstein classic set in the Alpine country. But despite being one of the most successful musicals of all time, it is barely known inside Austria.\\n \\n The film was never shown in any cinema in Austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s. The musical is based on the true story of the von Trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938.\\n \\n Sensitivities about Nazism during wartime Austria and issues towards the von Trapp family themselves could explain Austria's reluctance to embrace the musical. Another source of irritation for Austrians is the song Edelweiss, which is considered an traditional folk song by many filmgoers. The song was actually an invention by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of Austria, including yodelling, goat-herds and lederhosen. The production is being staged at a Viennese opera house, the Volksoper, beginning on Saturday.

It\\'s not my call though,\" he says. \"When the director says \\'music\\' the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall. We don\\'t usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off. \"The person that\\'s been cut off, who\\'s 10 feet from me, is glaring at me like it\\'s death time.\" On occasions, some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak. \"Julia Roberts, when she came on, she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do,\" he says. Conti received an Oscar in 1983 for the original score of The Right Stuff. He also received two nominations in the original song category in 1976 for Gonna Fly Now from Rocky and in 1981 for the title song from For Your Eyes Only.\\n \\n \"It\\'s a moment in the sun,\" he says. \"When people get up there, some people, this is hard to believe, people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining, might get a little flustered. \"But there\\'s this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they\\'re either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met.\"\\n \\n The image of the Oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories. Behind the scenes, the key players, such as Conti, have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with. \"There\\'s a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls. I can control hearing in my ears, the left ear or the right ear - different things at different times.\\n \\n \"I have to communicate with the director. I have a little microphone that\\'s attached to my headset. To open up that microphone, I have a footswitch,\" he explains. Conti\\'s most nerve-wracking moment came during his first Oscars show as musical director, in 1977, when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke. Conti immediately told the show\\'s director: \"I start cursing and screaming, I tell him we\\'re not going to die for this show - you must do something or I\\'m going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we\\'re going to be home in 10 minutes. \"\\'Oh no Bill don\\'t do anything,\" came the response. \"Imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra, 60 or so of them in the pit and while we\\'re playing, firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke.\" The smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands. \"No one died, it\\'s not a big story, but it was scary at the time,\" laughs Conti. When the ceremony is over, the music director attends the annual Governor\\'s Ball with his family. \"I have a drink and relive the show,\" he says. \"I\\'m not for too much carousing. I go home and unwind. It takes me about a day.\"\\n',\n",

But a venue spokesman said more than 5,500 tickets had been sold so far.\\n \\n Mr Rodgers, of the Fullness of Joy Church, said he was concerned about the rapper\\'s lyrics that include references to drugs, sex and violence, and songs that the minister said were demeaning to women. Ministers were worried that bringing such acts to Jonesboro would lead to problems. \"Tear the tickets up,\" Mr Rodgers said. \"Do not go and do not allow your children to go.\"\\n \\n Tim Dean, director of the Arkansas State University venue, said ticket sales had been brisk. \"It would appear that with ticket sales over 5,000, many others have expressed their right to find Nelly\\'s music entertaining and worth spending their time and money on,\" he said. Nelly has sold more than 30 million singles and albums worldwide, and in September 2004 simultaneously occupied the number one and two positions in the US albums chart. He has had 12 UK hit singles, including Hot in Herre, Dilemma and recent number one Over and Over.\\n',\n",

A man was shot in the thigh outside New York\\'s Hot 97 studios while 50 Cent was on air. More shots were fired outside his management offices two hours later. 50 Cent appeared on The Game\\'s debut album, which was number one in the US. 50 Cent, whose second album is about to be released after his debut made him one of hip-hop\\'s biggest stars, has been involved in recent rivalries with fellow artists including Fat Joe, Nas and Jadakiss.\\n \\n He has claimed credit for the success of The Game, who has become the hottest new star on the rap scene. Both were drug dealers and were shot before turning to music.\\n \\n In an interview with Hot 97 on Saturday, The Game described some of 50 Cent\\'s rivals as \"my friends\" and said he would not turn on them. \"Nas is one of my friends, and Jada\\'s really a homie,\" he said. \"50\\'s beef is 50\\'s beef and I really don\\'t know where all this stems from.\" When 50 Cent appeared on the same station two days later, he said The Game was no longer a member of G-Unit. \"Every record he\\'s selling is based on me being on his record with him,\" he said. When the shooting took place outside the studio, the interview was ended and the rapper was escorted out of the building by security personnel.\\n \\n An unidentified 24-year-old Los Angeles man is stable with a gunshot wound to the upper thigh. Police say The Game\\'s associates may have heard the interview and gone to the studio, where they confronted 50 Cent\\'s entourage. Officers are also investigating a later shooting in which eight bullets were fired into the door of 50 Cent\\'s management company, Violator. No arrests have been made in relation to either incident. 50 Cent\\'s second album, The Massacre, is released on Thursday, five weeks after The Game\\'s debut, Documentary, went to number one.\\n \\n Elliott Wilson, editor-in-chief of hip-hop magazine XXL, said the feud would boost publicity for 50 Cent\\'s release. \"It helps him obviously in terms of exposure. You can\\'t ask for better promotion,\" he said. But he added: \"I think he\\'s making more and more enemies. \"You definitely feel like is he doing too much of a Tupac spiral, like me against the world. You bring more people wanting to see you fail.\" Tupac Shakur was shot dead in 1996.\\n',\n",

Not that I ever did that. \"But things have moved on a lot now so it was time for a change.\"\\n \\n That change involved ejecting previous host Wes Butters and relocating King and DJ partner Joel Ross from their weekend afternoon Radio 1 slot. The pair have worked together for a decade - meeting on Viking Radio in Hull before moving to Manchester station Key 103 and winning two Sony Radio awards. They also presented gadget series Playboyz and car show Motor Maniacs for cable TV channel Granada Men and Motors, and Pure Soap on BBC Three.\\n \\n On the revamped chart show their cheeky, laddish banter will punctuate star interviews and competitions, film and DVD charts plus a look at future single releases, in addition to the singles chart itself. \"The chart rundown is no longer the only point of the programme,\" says Ross. \"The show used to be the only way to discover who was in the Top 40. Now you can just click on the internet to find that out, so the show has plenty of extra items too.\" The show\\'s reduced reliance upon the Top 40 also reflects the fact that music fans are now more likely to download songs in digital format rather than buy them on compact disc, vinyl or cassette.\\n \\n \"I personally buy downloads rather than CD singles,\" says 27-year-old Ross. \"Even my grandma can download songs now. JK is still struggling with the technology, though.\" \"But it\\'s premature for people to say that the singles chart is dead,\" Ross adds. \"While sales of singles on traditional formats are down, interest in songs has been revived by download sales, which will be incorporated into our main chart rundown from April. \"Music fans still want to know what is the most popular song of the week.\"\\n \\n Ross will be plumping for chart success from rapper Verbalicious and the Stereophonics on Sunday, while King is more of an R&B and dance music fan. \"So listeners will get the advantage of both our music tastes,\" says King, 30, who describes outgoing host Butters as \"an extremely professional and competent broadcaster\".\\n \\n \"The advantage Joel and I have is that we\\'re a double act, with a rapport between us that makes the show much more interactive,\" King says. \"Wes has a great broadcasting career ahead of him. And if not, I could always use a cleaner,\" he jokes. Ross says the pair have done their best to ignore the weight of expectation placed upon the revamped show. \"Other people can worry about that, we are going to continue doing what we do well,\" he says. \"At the end of the day this is a radio show that is meant to be entertaining. Nobody died.\"\\n',\n",

The pair had a recent dispute which saw The Game thrown out of 50 Cent's rap collective G-Unit, accusing him of disloyalty in an ongoing feud.\\n \\n 50 Cent, who burst onto the music scene in 2003, has had less success in the UK charts, with three singles making the top ten. His debut album, Get Rich And Die Tryin', narrowly missed out on becoming a UK chart topper.\\n \\n But in the US, he headed the 2003 end of year charts for the album and R&B and hip hop artists. Newcomer The Game's debut reached the top of the charts five weeks ago, while 50 Cent's second collection The Masscre was released in the US at the end of last week. Last May, R&B star Usher scored a chart first, with three concurrent singles in the US Top 10, a feat which was previously matched only by The Bee Gees and The Beatles. The hit songs were taken from the 24-year-old's Confessions album, which topped the American chart for eight weeks.\\n\",\n",

Groups including the Musicians\\' Union are calling for an end to the \"raw deal\" faced by British performers. US acts are not faced with comparable expense and bureaucracy when visiting the UK for promotional purposes.\\n \\n Nigel McCune from the Musicians\\' Union said British musicians are \"disadvantaged\" compared to their US counterparts. A sponsor has to make a petition on their behalf, which is a form amounting to nearly 30 pages, while musicians face tougher regulations than athletes and journalists. \"If you make a mistake on your form, you risk a five-year ban and thus the ability to further your career,\" says Mr McCune.\\n \\n \"The US is the world\\'s biggest music market, which means something has to be done about the creaky bureaucracy,\" says Mr McCune. \"The current situation is preventing British acts from maintaining momentum and developing in the US,\" he added.\\n \\n The Musicians\\' Union stance is being endorsed by the Music Managers\\' Forum (MMF), who say British artists face \"an uphill struggle\" to succeed in the US, thanks to the tough visa requirements, which are also seen as impractical.

The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be \"worth waiting for\". \"It will be like nothing they have ever seen before.\" \"I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn\\'t get a London theatre in time,\" added the British producer.

The Mary Poppins musical has been masterminded by theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh and directed by Richard Eyre with choreography by Matthew Bourne.

Spider-Man and its sequel made $1.6bn (Â£857m) at box offices worldwide. Of the cut now due to Lee, 82, who created Spider-Man in 1962, his lawyer said: \"It could be tens of millions of dollars, that\\'s no exaggeration.\" US District Court Judge Robert W Sweet ruled Lee should get a tenth of profits generated since November 1998 by Marvel TV and movie productions involving the company\\'s characters. Lee took legal action in 2002, saying Marvel shut him out of \"jackpot\" profits from the first blockbuster film.\\n \\n He said the company - where he worked for more than 60 years - had gone back on agreement to give him the 10%. As well as Spider-Man, Lee co-created the Incredible Hulk, X-Men, Daredevil and Fantastic Four characters. He said: \"I am gratified by the judge\\'s decision although, since I am deeply fond of Marvel and the people there, I sincerely regret that the situation had to come to this.\" The ruling also means he is entitled to a slice of profits from DVD sales and certain merchandise. Marvel said it would appeal and did not expect the decision to impact on financial forecasts for 2004 and beyond. The New York court did not rule on Lee\\'s claims to a share of profits from some Spider-Man and Hulk movie merchandise, which will be decided at a future trial, Marvel said.\\n',\n",

Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams\\' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\\n \\n \"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book.

We improvised quite a lot,\" says Bernath. \"At times it felt very chaotic but Mr Ghai was quite clear about what he wanted.\" Picked from more than 200 girls in an audition in London, Bernath cut short her education at Bristol\\'s Old Vic Theatre School to take up the opportunity. It is not often that somebody gets to play the lead role straight out of a drama school. She spent three weeks learning Hindi and taking dance lessons. \"Initially, I was a bit sceptical about how people would respond to me,\" Bernath says. \"But I found the Hindi film industry very warm and encouraging. I even had a few offers before the work on Kisna was completed.\"\\n \\n Films are one of India\\'s biggest exports and those like Lagaan and Monsoon Wedding have broken the traditional boundaries of colour and culture. Spurred by this, Bollywood producers are trying to go global in all aspects of film-making, be it technical or artistic.\\n \\n From young heart-throbs like Nick Moran of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to model Sophie Dahl, many non-Indian stars want to make the most of this opportunity. \"Bollywood has truly gone global,\" says Taran Adarsh, editor of Indian film journal Trade Guide. \"Directors are now attempting to woo non-Asian audience to increase their share in the overseas film market.\" Kisna has been shot simultaneously in Hindi and English, with the English print shortened by an hour to accommodate the Western audience. The film even has a song composed in English by AR Rahman, the director of the popular West End musical, Bombay Dreams. \"Identification is a popular cinematic device. Use of European or American actors can be viewed as a step in that direction,\" says Adarsh.\\n \\n The cast of Kisna also includes British actors Michael Maloney, Caroline Langrishe and Polly Adams.\\n \\n Another actress, Annabelle Wallace, plays the lead role in a bilingual romantic comedy Dil Jo Bhi Kahey (Whatever the Heart Says), which also stars Indian screen legend Amitabh Bachchan. Actor and Producer Aamir Khan\\'s forthcoming venture The Rising is set against the backdrop of the Indian mutiny of 1857, with British actor Toby Stephens in a key role. But it isn\\'t only the Western actors looking eastwards. Bollywood sweetheart Aishwarya Rai, recently seen in Bride and Prejudice alongside New Zealand actor Martin Henderson, is building her international career. And, many other Bollywood stars have their eyes set on Hollywood. \"Hollywood or Bollywood, it\\'s the box office that determines whether something is a passing phase or a trend,\" says Adarsh.\\n \\n Kisna - the Warrior Poet opens in the UK on 21 January.\\n',\n",

Open Water, Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State and Super-Size Me were all snapped up at last year\\'s festival. But stars like Keanu Reeves and Pierce Brosnan also have films showing there. The festival is being opened by a screening of quirky comedy Happy Endings, starring former Friends actress Lisa Kudrow and Maggie Gyllenhaal, on Thursday.\\n \\n Kudrow\\'s Friends co-star, David Schwimmer, plays a divorced drunkard in Duane Hopwood, while Brosnan stars as a hit man in comedy The Matador. Keanu Reeves appears in coming-of-age tale Thumbsucker while Kevin Costner and Michael Keaton are among the other big names whose films are involved. Robert Redford founded Sundance in 1981 and it has gone on to showcase future successes such as Reservoir Dogs, The Blair Witch Project and The Full Monty. But it has received criticism that it has become more commercial and mainstream over the years. \"As much as the press argues that Sundance has completely changed, it hasn\\'t changed that much,\" festival director Geoffrey Gilmore said. \"It\\'s still a place for discovery. It\\'s a place for common ground among film-makers and audiences more than it is the celebrity stuff.\" Other films generating interest before this year\\'s festival include Hustle & Flow, about an aspiring rapper, The Squid and the Whale, an autobiographical film by writer-director Noah Baumbach, and comedy/drama Pretty Persuasion.

       " 'Film production \\'falls\\' 40% in UK\\n \\n The number of British films produced in the UK fell 40% in 2004, with movies starring Johnny Depp and Jude Law among those affected, Screen Daily has said.\\n \\n Twenty-seven British films were made in the UK last year following a drop in funding, compared with 45 in 2003, according to the trade weekly. It attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the National Lottery. UK and US co-productions in Britain fell from 102 in 2003 to 81 last year.\\n \\n Last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the UK. Several projects were shelved as they faced the implications of this clampdown, coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional sources including the lottery and Miramax Films. Shooting on period drama Tulip Fever, which was to star Jude Law and Keira Knightley, was postponed indefinitely while shooting of The Libertine starring Johnny Depp was moved to the Isle of Man.\\n \\n \"There isn\\'t anything coming in to replace (the funds),\" said The Libertine\\'s executive producer Marc Samuelson. \"We are in a hiatus.\" Films with \"medium\" budgets of up to Â£9m, a similar level to box office hits Vera Drake, Calendar Girls and Enduring Love, are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown. The strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of US films shot in the UK during 2004, Screen International added. Big budget co-productions, such as the Harry Potter series, continued to be shot in the UK, however. The UK Film Council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for British film production, when Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Wimbledon and Thunderbirds were all filmed in the UK.\\n \\n \"The drop was expected as there was no way 2003\\'s record level of production could be bettered,\" the council\\'s spokesperson said. \"The reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors, including the continuing long-term trend towards co-production of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements.\" It was \"too early\" to predict whether the downward trend in UK production would continue throughout 2005, the UK Film Council said. In September the government introduced subsidies worth up to Â£4m per film for medium budget films, under new Treasury measures. It is also due to announce a replacement for UK film tax relief scheme Section 48 in July.\\n',\n",

Film studio Fox has bought the rights for around $4m (Â£2.13m) for Scott\\'s company Scott Free to develop. The director said he was \"thrilled\" with the project. \"Wolf Brother is an enchanting book,\" he said. Paver, who lives in London and previously worked as a lawyer, began writing the book in 1982 while studying biochemistry at Oxford University.\\n \\n She was an established author of love stories when she turned the work-in-progress into a children\\'s novel. It was published in 2004, with Paver earning an advance of $5m (Â£2.8m) - the highest sum ever paid for a debut children\\'s book. Wolf Brother tells the story of Torak, a 12-year-old hunter who lives in the forest. After his father is killed he teams up with a wolf cub and sets out to rid the forest of an evil force. Paver is currently writing the second book in the series. \"Michelle Paver lives and breathes the worlds she writes about,\" said a spokesman for the author. \"I\\'ve told her about the film deal but at the moment she is writing the second book and her mind is 6000 years away deep in the primeval forest.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'The comic book genius of Stan Lee\\n \\n Stan Lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit Spider-Man movies.\\n \\n Many marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stan Lieberman, got a job in Timely Publications, a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, now legally adopted.\\n \\n By the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\\n \\n Lee\\'s answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee\\'s life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York\\'s skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\\n \\n \"Just because he\\'s a hero and has super powers doesn\\'t mean he doesn\\'t have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee\\'s influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel\\'s covers.\\n \\n In 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. His latest project is a superhero based on a real person - Jay J Armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. But his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, The Hulk and Daredevil have all been turned into Hollywood action movies in the last five years. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (Â£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. It seems Stan Lee is as indestructible as his heroes.\\n',\n",
       " 'Bangkok film festival battles on\\n \\n Organisers of the third Bangkok International Film Festival have been determined to carry on with this year\\'s event despite the ravages of the Asian tsunami disaster.\\n \\n The festivities have been scaled down, red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund. Apart from this, however, the festival has continued as originally planned. \"When the disaster happened, we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel,\" said the festival\\'s executive director, Craig Prater. \"The decision was made that we would continue, but that the focus would change.\\n \\n \"Our premieres became fundraisers, the opening night was visibly toned down and 10% of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund,\" he continued. \"But we feel like we\\'ve turned a page. We\\'ve acknowledged our position, and now it\\'s business as usual.\"\\n \\n Mr Prater\\'s sentiments were echoed by Christine Rush, director of the festival\\'s sister event, the Bangkok Film Market. \"We have been careful to be respectful of the Thai nation\\'s recovery from this terrible disaster,\" she said.\\n \\n \"However, the nation\\'s recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life. \"We are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out,\" she added. Given the conspicuously low audience figures, that support may be more symbolic than significant. However, poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties.\\n \\n The eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles, including such Oscar hopefuls as Ray Charles biopic Ray and Mike Leigh\\'s abortion drama Vera Drake. That said, the absence of Thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers.\\n \\n On a more positive note, the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city. Problems securing air transport, the clash with last Sunday\\'s Golden Globes ceremony in Los Angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel.\\n \\n But the festival has still attracted such Hollywood directors as Oliver Stone and Joel Schumacher, alongside such screen stars as Michael Douglas, Jeremy Irons and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Irons, whose film Being Julia is in competition for the festival\\'s Golden Kinnaree awards, said he had wondered whether he should attend after December\\'s catastrophe. \"I questioned whether I should come when such a tragedy had happened,\" the British actor said. \"I thought it might be in rather bad taste. But then I spoke to the organisers and I was encouraged to let life go on. \"Now I\\'ve come here I\\'m very glad. What impresses me about Thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the West,\" he continued. \"Basically I was invited here by Thailand. If they still want you to come, you should.\"\\n \\n Now in its third year, Bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar. And while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Pusan in South Korea, Mr Prater predicts it will soon become their equal. \"It\\'s grown awfully fast in three years - maybe too fast,\" he concedes. \"We\\'ve had some bumps in the road, but that\\'s only because the festival is still a baby. \"I have no doubt in my mind that in five years, this will be the top Asian film festival in the world.\" The Golden Kinnarees will be awarded on Friday. The festival itself runs until 24 January.\\n',\n",

       " 'How the Academy Awards flourished\\n \\n The 77th annual Academy Awards are taking place on 27 February with the stars of the movie-making world once again holding their breath to discover who will be showered with the honours this year. But from humble beginnings, how did the modern day extravaganza become the behemoth it is today?\\n \\n HOW IT ALL STARTED The first Academy Awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel - just over the road from their modern day home.\\n \\n Just 250 guests attended with ticket prices at $5.\\n \\n The first film to win was Wings, which starred Clara Bow in the only silent movie to win the big award. For the first 10 years or so, the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm, but in 1940 the winners were published in the Los Angeles Times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results. As a result the sealed envelope system was introduced, leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today. WHEN AND WHERE The tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner.\\n \\n The ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous Grauman\\'s Chinese Theatre the first to host the expanded event. Other venues included the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Shrine Auditorium. They are now held at the Kodak Theatre, which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6,000 people. Until 1954 they were held on a Thursday, then swapped around from Monday to Wednesday before Sunday night was settled on, although the month swapped from May to April to March and now its current month of February. The first televised ceremony was in 1953, with Bob Hope as the MC. WHO WAS OSCAR? There is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as Oscar.\\n \\n One popular story is that Academy librarian Margaret Herrick said the statue looked like her uncle Oscar. A journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article.\\n \\n The first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist Sidney Skolsky used it to describe Katherine Hepburn\\'s first best actress win in 1934. The Academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939. The trophy was designed by MGM art director Cedric Gibbons. Since its inception 2,530 Oscars have been handed out. In support of the war effort, the Academy handed out plaster Oscar statuettes during WWII. After the war, winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing. Fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000, 52 were recovered nine days later. Winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out. WHO SITS IN JUDGEMENT? The Academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines. Douglas Fairbanks Sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards. There are now 5,700 members of the Academy - with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers. Some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the Academy, receipt of an Academy Award nomination, achievement of unique distinction, earning of special merit, or making an outstanding contribution to film. THE STARS WHO LEFT EMPTY-HANDED While many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the Academy, there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics.\\n \\n Among the overlooked films were Hobson\\'s Choice, Dirty Harry, The 39 Steps, The Searchers and King Kong. Actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included Al Jolson in the Jazz Singer (1927), Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca (1944), Gene Kelly in Singing in the Rain (1952) and Henry Fonda in 12 Angry Men (1957). Alfred Hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations. His enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968. THE SHOW ALWAYS GOES ON Not even war has halted the glittering Hollywood event. There were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in Iraq, but as it didn\\'t stop during World War II or the Vietnam war.\\n \\n Documentary winner Michael Moore ensured nobody forgot about the Iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the American invasion. The ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses. The ceremony has been postponed on three occasions. Los Angeles floods in 1938 saw it put back a week. The death of Martin Luther King saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. CONTROVERSIES AND OTHER GAFFES Three people have refused Oscars, including actor George C Scott who said the whole thing was \"demeaning\". Writer Dudley Nichols refused his Academy Award in 1935 for his screenplay for The Insider because the Writers\\' Guild was striking at the time. Marlon Brando turned down his best actor Oscar for The Godfather in 1973 in protest as Hollywood\\'s apparent discrimination against Native American people. He sent along a woman called Sacheen Littlefeather to collect his award. She was later revealed to be Native American actress Maria Cruz.\\n \\n The following year Robert Opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked, flashing a peace sign as well as everything else. The TV network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity. Opal was murdered in 1979. Frank Capra was the butt of one major gaffe in 1934 when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared \"come on up and get it, Frank\" to which Frank Capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant Frank Lloyd had won for Cavalcade.\\n \\n Capra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for It Happened One Night.\\n',\n",
       " 'Hoffman hits out over modern film\\n \\n Hollywood legend Dustin Hoffman has hit out at the quality of current films and theatre productions.\\n \\n The star of Rain Man and Tootsie said the film culture was \"in the craphouse\" at a press conference on Tuesday. The 67-year-old also said he stopped working a few years ago because he lost his \"spark\" for acting. Hoffman is in the UK to publicise his new comedy, Meet the Fockers, which also stars Robert De Niro, Barbra Streisand and Ben Stiller.\\n \\n He said: \"You go to the cinema and you realise you\\'re watching the third act. There is no first or second act. \"There is this massive film-making where you spend this incredible amount of money and play right to the demographic. \"You can tell how much money the film is going to make by how it does on the first weekend. \"The whole culture is in the craphouse. It\\'s not just true in the movies, it\\'s also true in the theatre. \"Broadway, and now London is the same, special effects are in great demand. It\\'s not a good time culturally.\"\\n \\n Hoffman also said he stopped working a few years ago and moved into directing and writing. He said: \"I just lost that spark I always had. \"A couple of years ago I didn\\'t like the parts I was getting. \"Studios weren\\'t interested in the kind of films that people of my generation wanted to see. \"I thought I would stop and just try writing and directing. I wasn\\'t aware of the depression that set in.\" Recently, Hoffmann has returned to film, with roles in I Heart Huckabees, Finding Neverland and now Meet the Fockers, which is the sequel to Meet the Parents. Meet The Fockers opens in the UK on Friday.\\n',\n",
       " 'Johnny Depp: The acting outlaw\\n \\n Johnny Depp, whose latest role was Peter Pan creator JM Barrie in Finding Neverland, is celebrated as one of Hollywood\\'s most maverick talents. Depp has become an unlikely major star, given his preference for taking dark and idiosyncratic roles instead of surefire box office hits. He has had a long-running working relationship with the equally unconventional director Tim Burton. Depp was born in Kentucky in 1963 and at first wanted to be a rock star, playing in a number of bands and supporting acts such as Iggy Pop and The B-52s in Florida. On a visit to Los Angeles, his former wife introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage.\\n \\n In 1984 he started his film career playing a doomed teenager in horror film Nightmare On Elm Street. Two years later he played a soldier in Oliver Stone\\'s Vietnam epic Platoon. But it was TV that first made Depp a star. He played undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the US series 21 Jump Street for three years from 1987.\\n \\n In 1990 he began his partnership with Burton in the dark fairy tale Edward Scissorhands, about a young man with blades for hands. He won plaudits in 1993 for the downbeat film What\\'s Eating Gilbert Grape, where he played a sensitive youth looking after an overweight mother and a retarded younger brother, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Another role under Burton, Ed Wood, starred Depp as the crazed cult film-maker Wood, in 1994. He played a much more serious, sensitive role in his next major film, Donnie Brasco, where he portrayed an undercover cop infiltrating a mafia ring. In 1997 he directed his only film to date - The Brave, the story of an Indian man offered money to appear in a snuff film.\\n \\n Two years later he played Hunter S Thompson in Terry Gilliam\\'s ambitious but poorly-received big screen adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. He worked again with Tim Burton in the 1999 horror film Sleepy Hollow, and appeared opposite Dame Judi Dench and Juliette Binoche in Chocolat. His performance in Pirates of the Caribbean, which earned him Golden Globe and Bafta nominations, had many critics thinking he based it upon the mannerisms of his friend, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. His latest role in Finding Neverland explored JM Barrie\\'s relationship with Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her children. Depp\\'s charismatic performance drew an audience of adults and children alike into Barrie\\'s vivid imagination, and he was called the \"fifth child of the group\" by the film\\'s director Marc Forster.\\n \\n He has two children of his own with French singer Vanessa Paradis, having previously been in a long-term relationship with British model Kate Moss. The theme of children\\'s literature in Depp\\'s career - and his long association with Tim Burton - are set to continue in his next role, playing Willy Wonka in a remake of Roald Dahl\\'s classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. British TV comedy fans might also remember Depp\\'s guest role in the final episode of BBC sketch programme The Fast Show, cited as his favourite show. It was another surprise move in Depp\\'s varied and intriguing career.\\n',\n",

Smith has yet to decide the line-up for Meltdown, which begins on 11 June. \"I want to touch on all aspects of our culture, perhaps with readings from Genet, and I have an idea for Jeremy Irons to read Proust,\" she said.\\n \\n The 58-year-old US singer of Because the Night told The Observer newspaper that the festival would be her response to these \"material, exploitative and greedy times\". \"It is important we explore the new, but we should also salute the best art there is, aesthetically and spiritually,\" she said. Last year\\'s Meltdown festival, directed by the ex-Smiths star Morrissey, included appearances by singer Jane Birkin, Nancy Sinatra and playwright Alan Bennett. He also persuaded punk band The New York Dolls to reform for a reunion show.\\n',\n",

Original band members Bryan Ferry, Phil Manzerana, Andy Mackay and Paul Thompson will take to the stage on the Saturday night of the festival. The band are also working in the studio on new material, their first since the 1982 album Avalon. Roxy Music were formed in 1971 by Ferry, Mackay and Brian Eno, with Manzanera joining the following year. Their first hit was 1972's Virginia Plain, with other hits including Street Life, Love Is The Drug and the 1981 John Lennon cover, Jealous Guy. Roxy Music's back catalogue was re-released in 2000, leading to the band undertaking a world tour in 2001. Morrissey will also play on Saturday at the festival, while Supergrass and Idlewild have been confirmed for the Friday.\\n\",\n",

Mr Fuller has been appointed to the CFX board and will plan and implement the company\\'s creative strategy. The 19 firm handles a roster of music artists, TV shows and PR strategies for stars including the Beckhams. The deal sees Mr Fuller receive Â£64.5m in cash and about 1.9 million shares in Sports Entertainment. There will also be a further Â£19.2m in either cash or stocks by the end of the financial year in June. Mr Fuller has signed a long-term agreement with the company which will see him continue to expand and develop entertainment brands. He said: \"This is a hugely exciting new partnership for myself and 19 Entertainment.\\n \\n \"CKX will provide 19 with a powerful platform for global growth and allow us to fully take advantage of all the amazing opportunities that lie ahead. I cannot wait to get started.\"\\n \\n Mr Fuller was the creative drive behind Pop Idol and its US offspring American Idol. 19 Management runs the careers of many of its successful contestants including Will Young, Gareth Gates and Kelly Clarkson. The company was set up 15 years ago by Mr Fuller, taking the name from his first successful single - 19 by Paul Hardcastle. Fuller was the driving force behind the Spice Girls phenomenon, using canny marketing and catchy pop songs to secure their place as the most lucrative girl group in history. He then put together S Club 7, who had their own TV show as well as a music career. Mr Sillerman\\'s deal to buy the Presley estate sees him control the operation of Graceland, as well as money from the late star\\'s music and films.

The Canadian music manager, who also managed Tommy Hunter and the Statler Brothers, had been in declining health, according to his family. An entrepreneur from an early age, Mr Holiff served as a rear air gunner in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, afterwards setting up a drive-in restaurant.

       " 'UK \\'world\\'s biggest music buyer\\'\\n \\n UK consumers are the biggest music buyers in the world, according to new figures released on Tuesday by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).\\n \\n But global sales of recorded music were flat in 2004, with growing sales in DVD music videos offset by online and physical piracy in major markets. The UK music industry recorded an overall 3% increase in volume sales, mostly due to its robust albums market. However, world music sales declined by 1.3% to $33.6 billion (Â£17.7 billion). The UK CD albums market grew by 4.5% in 2004 with a record 174.6 million units sold. On average every Briton buys 3.2 CDs per person per year.\\n \\n Around 26,000 albums are released in the UK each year, making Britain second only to the US in terms of the number of releases. Overall sales were driven by new UK-signed artists such as Keane, Katie Melua and Scissor Sisters, whose debut album sold almost 1.6 million copies in the UK. \"A slew of great new British artists have met UK music fans\\' demand for great music,\" said BPI chairman Peter Jameson. The best-selling album globally was Usher\\'s Confessions - one of eight albums to sell more than five million copies in 2004.\\n \\n The growth in the DVD market and a sharp increase in sales of digital music ensured a strong market in the US. The total number of tracks downloaded last year were up more than tenfold on 2003. Digital sales in the US in the first two months of 2005 are already more than double that of the same period in 2004.\\n \\n However, some markets in Continental Europe and Asia - notably Sweden, Finland, France, Spain and South Korea - have been drastically hit by internet piracy. Australia, Italy and the Netherlands also saw a decline. \"On the positive side digital sales are booming,\" said John Kennedy, chief executive of the International Federation of Phonographic Industries (IFPI). \"However, commercial piracy and illegal file-sharing are continuing to depress our markets. \"The priority in the coming year is to step up the advance of legitimate digital sales and sustain our anti-piracy efforts.\" \"The main choice today\\'s music fan now has to make is whether to get music legally or illegally,\" added Mr Jameson.\\n',\n",

Kate Winslet was also nominated in the best actress category for her role in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. And Clive Owen and Sophie Okonedo both got nominated for supporting roles in Closer and Hotel Rwanda respectively. Owen has already been made bookmakers\\' favourite for best supporting actor for the role in Closer that has already clinched him a Golden Globe award.\\n \\n And it is the first nomination for actress Okonedo, chosen for her performance in Hotel Rwanda, about the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It is also a debut nomination for Staunton, 49, who told BBC News 24 she had not thought the film would appeal to Academy voters. \"It was an extraordinary time making the film and I can\\'t believe what has happened this morning,\" she said. \"I hope it just shows Mike up to be the extraordinary filmmaker he is. \"We are also dealing with a very difficult subject matter and it is amazing to have it accepted in this way.\" Leigh, who had previously received three Oscar nominations for Secrets and Lies and Topsy Turvy, told BBC News 24 the latest success was \"amazing\". He said: \"We hoped that Imelda Staunton would get a nomination but I never expected to get director and screenplay. It\\'s just absolutely wonderful.\\n \\n \"I think people are aware that it\\'s about life - and I hope it is the warmth and compassion that really talks to people.\" Winslet said she was \"ecstatic\" about the fourth nomination of her career. \"Being nominated means so much to me. To be nominated for a film that was released a while ago, I feel so honoured and overwhelmed,\" she said. John Woodward, chief executive of the UK Film Council, said it was \"extremely heartening\" to see British filmmaking talent recognised on the global stage. \"Britain has a hugely talented industry and these nominations show why National Lottery investment in film pays major dividends for our culture and economy.\" Among a total of 24 British nominees, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Charles Hart are up for best original song for Learn To Be Lonely, from The Phantom of the Opera movie.\\n \\n Cinematographer John Mathieson, who was nominated for Gladiator in 2001, is also up for The Phantom of the Opera.

       " \"Moreno debut makes Oscar mark\\n \\n Catalina Sandino Moreno has joined a rare group of actresses who have been nominated for an Oscar for starring in a foreign language film.\\n \\n The Colombian-born actress was the final hope for director Joshua Marston, who scoured the US and Colombia for a lead for Maria Full of Grace. The film sees the 23-year-old play a teenage drug mule who smuggles heroin by swallowing pellets in condoms. Plaudits have been raining down on her for her gritty performance, making it all the more surprising that this is her first film. Her previous acting experience was in amateur productions in her home city of Bogota at the Ruben Di Pietro theatre academy. She has already received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Awards leading actress category but these rarely overlap with Academy Awards, instead recognising quirkier, low-budget films. And at the 2004 Berlin Film Festival the jury could not choose between her and Charlize Theron's Oscar winning performance in Monster so gave them a tied award. Sandino Moreno is now being regarded as one of the most promising actresses around at the moment. But she is taking her time committing to her next project, hoping to land a strong Spanish script and would love to be able to work with directors Pedro Almodovar or Alejandro Amenabar.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Bening makes awards breakthrough\\n \\n Film actress Annette Bening is up for an Oscar for her starring role in the award-winning film Being Julia.\\n \\n Bening, who was born in Texas in 1958, has gained prominence for a string of key roles. Although an Oscar has so far eluded her, her status as one of Hollywood\\'s favourite actresses remains solid. One of the biggest Oscars buzzes in recent years was for Bening\\'s role as troubled Carolyn Burnham in 1999\\'s American Beauty. But her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of Hilary Swank\\'s leading role in Boys Don\\'t Cry. After opening her career in the theatre - and gaining a Tony Award nomination in 1986 - Bening had a low-key spell in television. She then made her film debut as a sex-starved wife in 1988\\'s The Great Outdoors, opposite comics Dan Akroyd and John Candy.\\n \\n Following a cameo in Postcards From The Edge, Bening\\'s breakthrough role came in 1990, playing seductive con artist Myra Langtry in The Grifters - a role that won her an Oscar nomination. Despite some rave reviews, Bening did not win the best supporting actress Academy Award.\\n \\n However the high-profile performance enabled Bening to capture roles in a number of big budget Hollywood productions, co-starring with some of Hollywood\\'s greatest players, including Robert De Niro and Harrison Ford. But it was her role opposite Warren Beatty in 1991 gangster flick Bugsy which had the greatest impact. Bening played Virginia Hill, another role which won her high critical acclaim, but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 Oscar nominations.\\n \\n Bugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for Bening - she married Beatty, with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in Europe. The couple now have four children together. A pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered Bening\\'s career in the mid-1990s. She played Michael Douglas\\' opposite number in romantic comedy The American President, and as a \"fiery\" Queen Elizabeth I in a contemporary adaptation of Shakespeare\\'s Richard III.\\n \\n Bening was the first choice to play the female lead in American Beauty, director Sam Mendes\\' film debut which was a critical and commercial success - but the actress had to be content with a Bafta award for her strong performance. But current film Being Julia has made Bening an award-winning actress rather than the perennial nominee, with success at the Golden Globes. The witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s London sees the eponymous theatrical diva - played by Bening - grow tired of her success and fall for a young American - and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted Academy Award.\\n',\n",
       " 'Oscars steer clear of controversy\\n \\n The Oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer, less contentious cinema.\\n \\n If best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front-runners would have had to be Michael Moore\\'s Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and Mel Gibson\\'s The Passion of the Christ. Both films polarised opinion but had critics talking, and the public turning up to see them - Fahrenheit 9/11 breaking US box office records for a documentary, and The Passion of the Christ making more than US$370m (Â£196m) in the US alone. But this year\\'s Academy Awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with The Passion of the Christ - a film accused of being anti-Semitic - receiving nominations only in the \\'minor\\' categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score.\\n \\n Fahrenheit 9/11 has also been overlooked, despite winning the Palme d\\'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2004.\\n \\n Moore\\'s caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors\\' decision to enter it in the best picture category, rather than best documentary, says Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International. But he also believes the strong political viewpoint of Moore\\'s film does not sit well with the Academy. \"If you look at past Oscar winners and nominees, the very conservative Oscar voters tend to go for very conservative, epic-style pictures. Fahrenheit 9/11 didn\\'t really fit in to that category. \"They tend to go for films like Titanic, Gladiator, and the Lord of the Rings, films with scale that often aren\\'t too contentious,\" he said. While he said the Oscar voting panel were not \"snubbing\" Moore\\'s film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category. \"I think it\\'s more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub,\" he said.\\n \\n The problem with Mel Gibson\\'s film, he believed, was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in Aramaic, an ancient Middle Eastern language.\\n \\n \"Hollywood doesn\\'t tend to like foreign-language films - no-one\\'s ever tried doing a film in a dead language,\" he said. But aside from these two films, some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. The German film The Downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker, has been recognised in the best foreign film category. The film has caused some controversy in showing Hitler as a fallible but human man, rather than a semi-mythical, historical monster. But Mr Dams said: \"It\\'s not an inflammatory film. It has done very well in Germany, and it\\'s a film that portrays Hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster.\" Another \\'contentious\\' film, Mr Dams said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm.\\n \\n Independent film-maker Morgan Spurlock may have forced fast-food giant McDonalds to withdraw its \\'super size\\' portions in the US after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but McDonalds meals - and filmed his progress.\\n \\n The film has been a hit around the world. Mr Dams said: \"It\\'s a political film, but it\\'s quite fun and punky and well-paced. \"Morgan Spurlock is a really likeable guy. It\\'s a very accessible film, and it doesn\\'t beat you over the head with its views. \"While in Fahrenheit 9/11 there are moments of comedy, I think the way that Super Size Me is put together - the fact it\\'s a very likeable film - means it\\'s won through on charm.\" Dam\\'s pick at this year\\'s Oscars? The Aviator, Martin Scorsese\\'s biopic of aviation pioneer and Hollywood player Howard Hughes. Tinseltown, it seems, likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own.\\n',\n",

Lawyers for the pair denied allegations they had planted the device. The Australian actress is currently in Sydney to film her latest movie, Eucalyptus, with Russell Crowe. Kidman was prompted to take action following a reported high-speed car chase with members of the paparazzi in Sydney last weekend.\\n \\n According to local newspaper the Daily Telegraph, the incident involved paparazzi driving through red lights and on the wrong side of the road in pursuit of Kidman\\'s vehicle. Lawyers for Mr Fawcett and Mr McDonald denied that the pair were involved in the chase. Kidman sought the \"apprehended violence\" orders - normally used in Australia in cases of domestic violence and similar incidents - after being advised to do so by local police. \"Nicole would like to make it clear that she acknowledges she is a public figure and that reporters and photographers have a job to do and she respects that,\" said Kidman\\'s publicist Wendy Day. \"However, these are specific actions against two individuals who, over a period of time, have caused her to feel threatened, intimidated and unable to leave her home without fearing for her safety.\" Magistrate Lee Gilmore, who issued the restraining order at Waverley Local Court in Sydney, said she understood the photographers were entitled to earn a living but there had to be limits to their behaviour. \"Miss Kidman says she\\'s willing to put up with some of it, but it\\'s gone beyond that,\" she said. \"I do believe the allegation in relation to the driving is a serious issue.\"\\n',\n",

Fleming\\'s book saw the introduction of Bond pitted against a Russian spy in a game of baccarat. Simultaneously, a woman arrives on the scene to take his eye off the game. The novel is one of Fleming\\'s most violent and sadistic stories, with 007 suffering a savage beating from his nemesis Le Chiffre. In addition to the 1967 film, it was also adapted for television in 1954 with actor Barry Nelson as an Americanised \"Jimmy\" Bond. MGM Vice Chairman Chris McGurk said: \"Martin (Campbell) is an incredibly exciting film-maker. Goldeneye was a wonderful movie and helped reinvigorate the Bond franchise. We\\'re thrilled to have him back to direct the newest Bond.\" New Zealand-born Campbell moved to the UK in 1966 and directed TV series such as The Professionals, Minder and Bergerac.

       " \"Ray DVD beats box office takings\\n \\n Oscar-nominated film biopic Ray has surpassed its US box office takings with a combined tally of $80m (Â£43m) from DVD and video sales and rentals.\\n \\n Ray's success on DVD outstripped its $74m (Â£40m) US box office total, earning more than $40m (Â£22m) on the first day of the DVD's release alone. Ray has been nominated in six Oscar categories including best film and best actor for Jamie Foxx. The film recounts the life of blues singer Ray Charles, who died in 2004. In its first week on home entertainment release the film was the number one selling DVD, with the limited edition version coming in at number 11. Sony horror film The Grudge, starring Michelle Gellar, was the US' second best-selling DVD, with Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gere's romantic comedy Shall We Dance? at number three. Foxx's critically acclaimed performance as Ray has already earned him a Screen Actors Guild Award for best actor, as well as a prestigious Golden Globe. Ray director Taylor Hackford, responsible for the classic 1982 film An Officer and a Gentleman, has also received an Oscar nomination in the best director category. The film's three other Oscar nominations are for costume, film editing and sound mixing.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Women in film \\'are earning less\\'\\n \\n Women in the UK film industry earn less than their male counterparts despite being better qualified, according to a study released on Wednesday.\\n \\n Only 16% of women earn more than Â£50,000, compared with 30% of men. Women make up a third of the workforce. The research was carried out jointly by the UK Film Council and industry training body Skillset. It also found that women in the industry were less likely than men to be married or have dependant children.\\n \\n The study, which claims to be the most in-depth so far conducted, found 60% of women in the film industry hold degrees, compared with 39% of men. Whilst 17% of men in the industry had no qualifications, this was true for only five per cent of women. In the lower salary bracket, 35% of women earn less than Â£20,000 a year, compared to only 18% of men. The research found very few women worked in the camera, sound, electrical and construction departments, but they made up a majority of those working in make-up and hairdressing.\\n \\n UK Film Council chief executive John Woodward said: \"Whilst the UK has benefited hugely from its highly-qualified film production workforce there are still many barriers facing people who want to get in and stay in the industry.\" \"Developing the film production workforce must be underpinned with a commitment to diversity as well as training.\" The workforce is largely focused around London, with 78% in the industry based in the capital and the south east of England. The industry depends heavily on word of mouth, with 81% being recruited in that way. In total, only five percent of the workforce is made up of ethnic minorities, although in London the figure rises to 24%. The necessity of completing unpaid work experience to get into the workforce has also shot up, from 5% before the 1980s, to 45% after 2000.\\n',\n",
       " 'Vera Drake\\'s Bafta triumph hope\\n \\n At the Bafta film awards on Saturday night, there is the prospect that a home-grown movie could walk off with a clutch of trophies.\\n \\n Vera Drake, Mike Leigh\\'s tale about a 1950s backstreet abortionist, is nominated in 11 categories. These include best film, best director and best actress shortlist for Imelda Staunton who plays the eponymous character. The film has spent months being lauded with prizes, from the Venice Film Festival to five awards from the London Critics\\' Circle on Wednesday night.\\n \\n The Baftas has a tradition of honouring British cinema, and this year Vera Drake is the obvious candidate to be heaped with praise. Empire magazine\\'s reviews editor Dan Jolin said the film had \"a very good chance\" of doing well on Saturday, predicting that it would collect five or six awards. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s going to do a Lord of the Rings-style sweep, but Imelda Staunton is a shoo-in for best actress,\" he said.\\n \\n \"A best director prize for Mike Leigh and best British film are also likely and it could steal some awards from heavily-nominated competitors The Aviator and Finding Neverland.\" Mr Jolin tipped another contender - most likely The Aviator - to walk away with the Bafta for best film, and added that Finding Neverland had been lavished with nominations but not trophies. Strong Oscar contenders Million Dollar Baby and Sideways did not figure in the Bafta nominations, giving Vera Drake greater potential to walk away with the big prizes.\\n \\n \"There is a sense that this film is ours and we should slap our own guys on the back. Out of all the films in the running for the Baftas, Vera Drake is the true blue British one.\"\\n \\n \"If Mike Leigh is going to win awards for anything, it should be Vera Drake at this year\\'s Baftas\", said Mr Jolin, adding that the film was probably his most technically accomplished and lavish work yet. Mr Jolin also tipped Phil Davis for a best supporting actor prize for his role in Vera Drake but felt that Heather Craney could be outdone by Kate Winslet or Natalie Portman in the supporting actress category. \"If there is anywhere where this film is going to win, it will be at the Baftas,\" he said.\\n \\n The Guardian\\'s film critic Peter Bradshaw felt that there \"might well be\" a sweep of awards for Vera Drake on Saturday night. \"I hope that Bafta voters will respond to the extremely high standard of acting from the whole cast of the film. If Bafta can\\'t do so, what hope is there?\" he said. Mr Bradshaw felt that Mike Leigh\\'s \"masterpiece\" was entitled to the best film award - leaving Dead Man\\'s Shoes, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, My Summer of Love and Shaun of the Dead to slug it out for the best British film trophy. \"I will be cheering if Vera Drake wins a whole host of awards,\" he added.\\n',\n",
       " 'Roundabout continues nostalgia trip\\n \\n The new big-screen version of The Magic Roundabout, released in the UK on Friday, is the latest attempt to turn children\\'s television into box-office gold.\\n \\n Recent years have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show Thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of E Nesbit\\'s Five Children and It, previously filmed by the BBC in 1991. He-Man and Transformers, which were cartoon favourites in the 1980s, will soon receive their own costly makeovers. With screen versions of The A-Team, The Dukes of Hazzard and even Blake\\'s Seven on the cards, nostalgia is clearly big business. But some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals. The new version of The Magic Roundabout, which will be released as Sprung! in the US, replaces the stop-motion models of the 1960s TV show with polished, computer-generated animation.\\n \\n In a similar fashion, the 2004 Thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original\\'s puppets and models. The films are squarely pitched at younger audiences. Pop stars Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue provide voices in The Magic Roundabout, while the now-defunct boy band Busted performed the Thunderbirds theme song. But while some reviewers have been won over, there has nonetheless been a significant backlash. \"This CG-animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the 60s stop-motion Roundabout a cult hit,\" writes Stella Papamichael on the BBC Movies site.\\n \\n And the recent puppet comedy Team America: World Police was in part provoked by its directors\\' outrage that Gerry Anderson\\'s Thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins. Dan Jolin, reviews editor of Empire magazine, says classic children\\'s TV shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.\\n \\n \"I can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today. \"But I think it\\'s backfiring. What\\'s next - The Clangers on some distant planet, with some giant CGI Soup Dragons chasing after them?\" Despite Thunderbirds\\' disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (Â£22m) but only recouped $21m (Â£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating. It can therefore be only a matter of time before some other TV favourites receive the Hollywood treatment.\\n \\n After the success of Garfield: The Movie, Britain\\'s shabby tabby\\n \\n surely deserves his own film vehicle. With only 13 episodes made of the 1974 series, there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat, Professor Yaffle and the Mice of the Marvellous Mechanical Mouse Organ.\\n \\n Furry recyclers\\n \\n have already had one big-screen outing - 1977\\'s Wombling Free. But with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback. Advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the BBC\\'s supernatural comedy\\n \\n . And the success of Pirates of the Caribbean must surely herald a comeback for TV\\'s most popular cartoon buccaneer,\\n \\n . It might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed.\\n \\n The Magic Roundabout is out in the UK on 11 February.\\n \\n \\n \\n How about bringing Catweazle to the big screen? He could give Gandalf a run for his money!\\n \\n Thundercats!! I loved it. Should be fun to see on the big screen, if some effort is put in! it will bring my youth back!\\n \\n Get your hands off the Clangers! Is nothing sacred?\\n \\n Make a movie version of the Banana splits!\\n \\n What about Keanu Reeves and Richard Gere in a remake of The Wooden Tops? Or perhaps Robbie Williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of Andy Pandy.\\n \\n You forgot to mention the grearest of them all, Danger Mouse! But then again, it couldn\\'t be better than the original series, could it?\\n \\n It\\'s always nice to see these old toons re-released, but after the abysmal Thunderbirds movie (and the song!) I think I\\'ve been completely put off. Just leave these classics alone as good memories.\\n \\n I think remakes are a good idea. As the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe. I believe this is the whole reason \"retro\" has become so popular. As long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series. Personally i\\'d like to see cartoons such as Transformers, Thundercats and M.A.S.K. get full Hollywood remakes.\\n \\n Leave them alone, why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place? The thunderbirds film was apalling, not a patch on the puppet series I grew up with and the Magic Roundabout will never be the same without the voice of Eric Thompson.\\n \\n Love to see Transformers with real actors and CGI. And make it at least a 15 rating.\\n \\n Part of the reason for the success of such classics as the Magic Roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect. They were moody, sarcastic, and rather human. Just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved. Dougal never smiled like that! Films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of Disneyfying everthing, and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place.\\n \\n I have fond memories of Bod (not least of which because I look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film. It\\'s got all the right material for an american blockbuster - no plot and no story. Bod would likely be played by Tom Cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two.\\n \\n It\\'s all very well and good remaking these classic TV shows and films with all the latest technology for a \\'new\\' audience, but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this, and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it. It maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice, but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as Thunderbirds and Magic Roundabout which are part of our childhood, they are never going to live up to expectation. It does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made, are film-makers running out of original ideas?\\n \\n All I can say is bring back Danger Mouse, probably the greatest kids\\' show ever. I recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in Danger Mouse that was completely lost on me when I was a child.\\n \\n There WAS a new Captain Pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back. Again, like so many of these nostalgia programmes, the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original\\'s cut out paper technique for inventiveness, and was woefully inadequate. We live in a sampling world - the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration, clipping sounds from 20 years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new. Seems that the film and TV is doing the same now - it\\'s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them, rather than being daring and trying something new.\\n \\n It got to be Mr.Benn. The story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop, steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing! If they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great. And who to play the lead role? Well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like Steve Martin. If its going to be an adventure then Johnny Depp playing a role similar to the Pirates Of The Caribbean Character.\\n \\n Muffin the Mule perhaps ? After all, grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know!\\n \\n Why can\\'t the British film industry try making Gerry Anderson\\'s UFO or Captain Scarlet, or Saphire and Steel, or The Tomorrow People.\\n \\n In today\\'s media, it seems the past is the future. TV shows such as Battlestar Galactica have new remakes, DJ\\'s are sampling or re-working 70\\'s and 80\\'s music. Even computer games from 10-15 years ago are getting modern re-workings. Personally, I think it shows that no one has any originality any more! Why not just leave our misty-eyed nostalgia alone.\\n \\n Mary, Mungo and Midge. But of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs. Plus would Mary be more of a Vicky Pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block? Yeah but no but I wasn\\'t even there!\\n \\n I\\'d like to see Mr. Benn, with Brad Pitt in the title role. Sean Connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner.\\n \\n It demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today\\'s film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia. There are plany of modern children\\'s book that would make excellent films or TV programmes, why not use them instead of rehashing the past?\\n \\n Mr. Benn with Rowan Atkinson as the lead.\\n \\n Would have loved to see Dungeons & Dragons made, but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn\\'t come up to scratch. The only one that isn\\'t to be remade as yet is Thundercats, which I\\'d like to see.\\n \\n I\\'m an expat living in Norway, and I recently went through a period of buying the DVDs of many of my favourite children\\'s programs for my 2 daughters. My dearest wish, however, is to see a feature length version of Noggin the Nog appear on The Big Screen!! Very Scandinavian...\\n \\n Rainbow!\\n \\n I believe that Childrens classics should be left well alone, and I will not be surprised if the Magic Roundabout does not do well at the Box Office, especially since it will be going up against The Spongebob Squarepants movie, popular among children because it\\'s original, witty, and modern. The Magic Roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.\\n \\n How about classics like Chorlton and the Wheelies, Rentaghost, Terrahawks, Bod.....oh the list could go on and on!!!\\n \\n If a Transformers movie is indeed on the cards then I\\'ll be the first one on Amazon buying a copy, eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch. Repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price! I don\\'t care! Till then I\\'ll have to make do with the Citreon C4 advert.\\n \\n I\\'d luv to see Willow the Wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late Kenneth Williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same. And who remembers Trap Door voiced by the late Willie Rushden, superb children\\'s programme. Could Morph hold his own in a big screen movie??? Or even Jamie and the Magic Torch....hmmmmm, I could go on and on. Danger Mouse? At 34 I\\'m showing my age. :-)\\n \\n Noggin the Nog was one of the best children\\'s programs. The problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach Oliver Postgate\\'s wonderful voices. So in general leave well alone. The originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story.\\n \\n Just imagine what could be achieved by using CGI in a remake of Fingerbobs... the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy, Yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like Fingermouse\\n \\n Bob the Builder, Postman Pat and Fireman Sam together in an epic adventure of fire, post and bricks. In the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns, Krusty and Gobo. Will they triumph or will they fail miserably? Find out this Fall.\\n \\n One puppet show that I personally would love to see made into a live action movie is Joe 90. It would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of Joe\\'s car. Of course, Gerry Anderson\\'s Supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big-screen, big-budget action. It was only that Thunderbirds The Movie was targetted as a children\\'t movie that really let it down. After all, the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves.\\n \\n It\\'s only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods, isn\\'t it? I\\'d hate to see Bagpuss with perfect animation - I love that \\'done in a shed\\' clunkiness and you couldn\\'t recreate the magic. Perhaps if the remakes were done in a \\'Look Around You\\' mock-authentic style I might be interested ...\\n \\n Chorton And The Wheelies or Jamie And His Magic Torch; that would be mega!\\n \\n This re-gurgitation of old films and TV shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people\\'s ideas, because it guarantees to bring in the $$$. The same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material, Will Young etc. The sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short-term. The fact that they will be forgotten in 6 months time is irrelevant (e.g. Starsky & Hutch) Hence, the market is saturated with this mindless drivel, but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it!\\n \\n I pray they never do a remake of Chorlton And The Wheelies. I\\'m only 27 and don\\'t remember the series from when it was on TV, but have the set on DVD and it\\'s a classic. The fact it\\'s so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to today\\'s stuff it looks amateurish. Thats the appeal though, it\\'s so innocent (like Chorlton himself) and it would be a real shame if they did remake it.\\n',\n",
       " 'Stars shine on Bafta red carpet\\n \\n Hollywood stars brought a touch of glamour to London on Saturday for the biggest night in the British film calendar.\\n \\n Cate Blanchett, Leonardo DiCaprio and Richard Gere were just some of the actors who attended the 2005 Bafta film awards. They emerged from limos at Leicester Square to an uncertain British climate that threatened rain one moment and promised late winter sunshine the next. But the gods were certainly shining on the thousands of film fans who lined the red carpet to meet their idols. Screaming built up into a crescendo as more and more big name stars appeared. The biggest cheer of the night was reserved for The Aviator star Leonardo DiCaprio, who paused in the chilly February air to sign autographs for the throngs. He said the ear-piercing welcome was \"unlike anything I\\'ve ever encountered. It\\'s very intense and very loud.\"\\n \\n Best actress winner Imelda Staunton, who wore a green chiffon dress that sparkled with sequins and beads, told the BBC News website that Vera Drake was the highlight of her career. Her role as a backstreet abortionist in the gritty low-budget film has already led to a clutch of awards and an Oscar nomination. She said: \"Never in a million years did I think this was going to happen. \"Being here and just being nominated is great, but I hope it means more people will go and see the film as well.\" Rooting for Staunton in the best actress category was Cate Blanchett, herself nominated for her supporting role as Hollywood icon Katherine Hepburn in The Aviator.\\n \\n Shivering in a floor-length shimmering Armani dress, the Australian-born actress stopped to sign autographs and joked: \"It\\'s tight but I love it.\" Glamour was also brought to the evening by actress Sienna Miller, supermodel Claudia Schiffer - who was supporting her director husband Matthew Vaughn - Troy actress Diane Kruger and star of the TV programme The OC, Micha Barton. Wearing a caramel-coloured floaty frock by the designer Alexander McQueen, Miller told reporters the red carpet experience was \"intense, nerve-wracking and cold\". The younger stars of British film were also represented in the shape of Emma Watson, who plays Hermione in the Harry Potter films. The 14-year-old said she was hoping to meet DiCaprio and Keanu Reeves but joked that \"they are probably a little too old for me\".\\n \\n Actor Christian Slater, who is currently starring in One Flew Over The Cuckoo\\'s Nest in London\\'s West End, was greeted by cries of \"Christian, Christian\" by the ever vocal crowd. Keanu Reeves, who presented the best actress award, said being on the red carpet was an \"exciting\" part of his job. \"It is always surreal and when it is nice, it is nice,\" he said. Martin Scorsese, whose movie The Aviator went on to win best film, said being honoured in the UK meant a lot to him. He said: \"I am a great admirer of British cinema since the 1930s and 40s, up until now.\\n \\n \"They give me a new energy when I see the best coming out of England and every two or three years is a whole new cycle of tough and young film-makers, and even the older ones are making good films. \"To recognise me in this way is a great honour.\" British actor Clive Owen, who has won a Golden Globe and a Bafta for his supporting role in Closer, said it \"meant a lot\" to be at the ceremony. He said: \"Just to be here really, at the Baftas. The bottom line is it is a celebration of British films.\"\\n',\n",

She arrived at the ceremony wearing a green silk and chiffon low cut evening dress decorated with beads. \"It\\'s lovely to be here at home, to be on British soil. It\\'s very nice indeed,\" she told reporters.\\n \\n Asked whether she was nervous about her best actress nomination she said: \"It\\'s out of my hands, there\\'s nothing I can do.

Friends and family, including actress Ruby Dee his wife of 56 years, gathered at the Riverside Church on Saturday. Also present at the service was former US president Bill Clinton and singer Harry Belafonte, who gave the eulogy. \"He would have been a very good president of the United States,\" said Mr Clinton. \"Like most of you here, he gave more to me than I gave to him.\"\\n \\n The 87-year-old was found dead last weekend in his hotel room in Florida, where he was making a film. Police said that he appeared to have died of natural causes. Davis made his acting debut in 1950 in No Way Out starring Sidney Poiter. He frequently collaborated with director Spike Lee, starring in seven Lee films including Jungle Fever, Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X. Attallah Shabazz, the daughter of activist Malcolm X, recalled the famous eulogy delivered by Davis at her father\\'s funeral. \"Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its finest hopes,\" she said, quoting the man she knew as Uncle Ossie. \"Ditto.\" \"Ossie was my hero, and he still is,\" said Aviator star Alan Alda, a family friend for over forty years. \"Ossie was a thing of beauty.\"\\n \\n \"I want so badly someday to have his dignity - a little of it anyway,\" added Burt Reynolds, Davis\\'s co-star in the 90s TV comedy Evening Shade. Before the midday funeral, scores of Harlem residents formed a queue outside the church to pay their respects to Davis. \"It is hard to fathom that we will no longer be able to call on his wisdom, his humour, his loyalty and his moral strength to guide us in the choices that are yet to be made and the battles that are yet to be fought,\" said Belafonte, himself an ardent civil rights activist who had been friends with Davis for over 60 years. \"But how fortunate we were to have him as long as we did.\"\\n',\n",

The Aviator was declared best film, and its star Cate Blanchett won best supporting actress. But Vera Drake scored best director for Mike Leigh while Imelda Staunton took the hotly contested best actress award. Jamie Foxx won best actor for Ray, while British actor Clive Owen took best supporting actor for Closer. The two actors have repeated their success at the Golden Globes in January. But big British hope Kate Winslet walked away empty-handed on Saturday despite two nominations for best actress. Celebrating his win, the Oscar-nominated Owen told reporters: \"The whole award season is new to me because I haven\\'t won anything before. All of that is a bit overwhelming.\" Blanchett, who won a Bafta in 1999 for her leading role in Elizabeth, said: \"Winning a Bafta means an enormous amount to me.\" She thanked the woman she played, Katharine Hepburn, for paving the way for women to work in film. \"Thank you very much, I\\'m sure you\\'re pleased, although you\\'re not able to see this,\" she said.\\n \\n The Aviator took four awards in all, also collecting best make-up and hair and production design, while Vera Drake also scooped best costume design.

I\\'m so thrilled and so grateful and I\\'m delighted that the success of Vera Drake has boosted sales of hair nets and pinnies, which is very good,\" she said on accepting her award. Her director Leigh, who beat Martin Scorsese to the best director award, told the audience: \"We always say it was a surprise and sometimes I\\'ve said it and not meant it. On this occasion, given the other names, it\\'s a real surprise and an extraordinary honour. \"It\\'s an immense privilege to have been allowed the freedom to make as uncompromising a film as I think Vera Drake is and an epic with such a small budget.\" Best actor Foxx could not make the ceremony, but actress Helen Mirren read out his acceptance speech. \"I\\'m honoured and proud to receive this Bafta. I\\'d like to thank the late Ray Charles himself.\" He apologised for not being in London, joking: \"Unfortunately I\\'m stuck driving a car in LA at gunpoint and I can\\'t get away.\" DiCaprio, who lost out on the best actor Bafta to Foxx, will face him again at the Academy Awards in two weeks\\' time.\\n \\n \"It\\'s the first time I\\'ve come to the Baftas because it\\'s the first time I\\'ve been nominated,\" he told reporters on the red carpet. \"I\\'ve appreciated British cinema for a long time and to be recognised like this is a special honour.\" Other winners included The Motorcycle Diaries which took best foreign film and best music, while Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind won best original screenplay and best editing. Best British film was My Summer of Love, the story of two young women and their developing relationship, while Foxx\\'s movie Ray, a bio-pic of late singer Ray Charles, also took best sound.

They will set up a charity to raise money to buy the Palace Theatre, and hope to reopen it to audiences in summer 2006. It is estimated that Â£500,000 is needed to buy the Grade II listed building. The Palace Theatre, which will be known as The Pavilion Repertory Theatre, was sold to an undisclosed bidder at auction 13 months ago for Â£340,000. Before that it had been used as a nightclub for 10 years.\\n \\n Oscar-winner Sir Anthony Hopkins, who was born in nearby Port Talbot, made his professional debut there, and Charlie Chaplin and Lily Langtry have also trodden its boards. Fox told the South Wales Evening Post that after visiting the theatre he was surprised by its beauty. \"A lot of money needs to be spent on it, but all the bones are there - it just needs a beautiful skin,\" he said.\\n \\n \"To call it a jewel is not an over-estimation. There are not many theatres left like this. \"The hope for the immediate future is that we can attract enough people to come forward to allow it to prosper,\" he told the newspaper.\\n \\n Fox first found fame in the 1960s. One of his most memorable roles was as an assassin in the Day of the Jackal in 1973, and he won a TV Bafta as the Prince of Wales in 1980 for Edward and Mrs Simpson. He was brought on board to save the theatre by Mr Palmer, a long-standing friend of 40 years. \"Two years ago I decided to return to Swansea and do something for the city,\" said Mr Palmer. He said he was excited by the idea of running the Palace as a charity where young actors could develop, and with an annual Shakespeare festival in the summer. \"If in five years\\' time the theatre can function in all areas without me, I shall be well satisfied having helped to create a vital living theatre for the city,\" he added. Keith Poulton, a business adviser from Swansea, has already committed an undisclosed amount of money to the project. \"We need at least Â£75,000 to secure a deposit on the building and we\\'ve only got two months to do that,\" said Mr Poulton. \"A few benefactors have expressed their interest and Mr Fox is going to give it an awful lot of time,\" he added. Last year, roads around the theatre were cordoned off when masonry from its roof fell onto a car, but engineers said they were happy that it was safe.\\n',\n",

Shark Tale is now the sixth-highest earning DVD for first week sales. The all-time first-week record is held by 1995's Lion King followed by Shrek 2, Finding Nemo, the original Shrek, and Monster's Inc.\\n \\n Shark Tale, whose voice cast includes Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renee Zellweger and Martin Scorsese, sold more than 6 million DVDs and videos across the United States and Canada. It becomes the highest first-week earner for February, outshining My Big Fat Greek Wedding which sold four million units in 2003. Films which are expected to earn strong home video returns are usually timed for release in the busiest retail season which falls before Christmas. The best-selling home video of last year was the Dreamworks hit Shrek 2, which took an estimated $458 m (Â£242.7m) in North America alone.\\n\",\n",

She said: \"I very much wanted to be in London but unfortunately I\\'m not well. At the advice of my doctors I\\'m unable to travel.\" Co-star Richard Gere attended the event held in aid of the tsunami appeal. Thousands braved the cold weather to see the stars in London\\'s Leicester Square. The red carpet boasted waltzing dancers in honour of the film\\'s ballroom dancing theme. The film\\'s director Peter Chelsom said he was disappointed that Lopez did not attend.\\n \\n \"It\\'s a shame. I know it\\'s true that she\\'s not well because she has also cancelled her promotional tour.

       " 'Super Size Me wins writers\\' award\\n \\n Super Size Me director Morgan Spurlock has won the Writers Guild of America\\'s award for documentary feature writing.\\n \\n The Oscar-nominated film followed Spurlock as he ate only McDonald\\'s fast food for an entire month. Spurlock was given the award at a special ceremony at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood on Tuesday. Organisers said the rising popularity of documentary films led them to honour a writer for a documentary screenplay for the first time.\\n \\n Producer Brian Grazer presented the award to Spurlock and the film\\'s backers, Roadside Attractions, Samuel Goldwyn Films and Showtime Independent Films. Spurlock set out to discover the effect of living on nothing but McDonald\\'s for a month, upgrading to supersize portions when offered. The film followed his 25lb weight gain and the health effects on his body, including his liver and cholesterol levels. McDonald\\'s announced it was to scrap its \"supersized\" meals last year, but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by Spurlock\\'s film. Spurlock was given his award on the same day the European Court of Human Rights ruled that two UK activists should have been given legal aid in their long fight against a McDonald\\'s libel action. Helen Steel and David Morris, from north London, dubbed the \"McLibel Two\", were found guilty in a 1990s trial of libelling the company in a leaflet they had been handing out At the end of the case the High Court in London ruled McDonald\\'s had been libelled and awarded the company Â£60,000 in damages, later reduced to Â£40,000 on appeal. But he found the leaflet was true in some aspects.\\n',\n",
       " \"Original Exorcist to be screened\\n \\n The original version of horror prequel Exorcist: The Beginning, dropped by producers over claims it was not scary enough, is to have its world premiere.\\n \\n The film, directed by Paul Schrader, will be screened on 18 March at the International Festival of Fantastic Film in Brussels. The psychological drama stars Stellan Skarsgard and foreruns the 1973 film. Schrader was replaced by director Renny Harlin who made a new version of the film which debuted in 2004. The prequel project was originally announced in 2001, with actor Liam Neeson in the lead role and John Frankenheimer as director. However Frankenheimer pulled out in 2002, a month before he died.\\n \\n Skarsgard then replaced Neeson in the role of Father Merrin, made famous by Max Von Sydow in the 1973 film. Principal footage was shot in Morocco and Rome at a reported cost of $32m. However, in August 2003 it emerged that producers Morgan Creek were shelving Schrader's version of the film, having complained it was not scary enough. As well as replacing Schrader with Harlin - the director behind Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger - the producers also changed most of the cast, but Swedish star Skarsgard stayed in the Merrin role. Harlin's film, released in the UK in October 2004, received lukewarm reviews but went on to make over $76m (Â£40.7m) worldwide. The festival screening will be the first time that Schrader's film has been seen in public. Reports that it will be released either in cinemas or on DVD have yet to be confirmed. Other films at the festival in the Belgium capital, which runs from 11-26 March, include the US horror hit Boogeyman and the forthcoming sequel Ring 2, as well as a selection of films adapted from the works of Jules Verne.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Oscar nominees lack pulling power\\n \\n This year\\'s clutch of Oscar nominees have been the least popular for 20 years according to box office figures.\\n \\n In the US the five nominated for best film have been seen by 50% fewer people than movies in previous years. While the awards are not based on box office popularity there is concern for the ratings of the televised ceremony. \"We don\\'t have a Titanic or a Lord of the Rings out there. I think it\\'s fair to say it does concern us a bit,\" said Academy executive director Bruce Davis. About 51 million people in the US have seen this year\\'s nominees, compared with between 100 million and 118 million in recent years. The last time combined attendance was so low was in 1984 when Amadeus beat The Killing Fields, A Passage to India, Places in the Heart and A Soldier\\'s Story to best picture, when 41 million saw the five films. Last year\\'s ceremony attracted the highest audience in four years as viewers tuned in to see Lord of the Ring: Return of the King sweep the board.\\n \\n And the show reaped its biggest audience in 1997 when Titanic took home 11 Oscars.\\n \\n The film had taken $500m (Â£264m) worldwide before the ceremony, and eventually took $1.8bn (Â£952m). \"Eyeballs starring at the movie screen translates to eyeballs staring at the TV screen,\" said Paul Dergarabedian of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations. \"People like to have a vested interest in what they\\'re watching. \"When Titanic does $1.8bn in worldwide box office, you\\'ve got a lot of people with a vested interest.\" Past years have also seen blockbusters such as Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump and Ghost compete for Oscars. The biggest box office hitter among this year\\'s nominees is The Aviator, which has taken $90m (Â£48m) in the US, although takings in the UK have reached only Â£7m so far.\\n \\n Low-budget move Sideways and Finding Neverland have so far grossed about $45m (Â£24m) each. The year\\'s biggest blockbusters do actually feature in the Oscar nominees but in the animation category. Shrek 2 and The Incredibles took $436m (Â£231m) while The Incredibles took $259m (Â£137m). Mel Gibson\\'s The Passion of the Christ, which took $370m (Â£196m) in the US, was largely ignored by Academy voters.\\n \\n But many in the film industry do not equate award and box office success. \"I have never equated the Academy Awards with how much money a movie takes in,\" said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution at Universal which released nominee Ray. \"That\\'s the People\\'s Choice Awards. This is not about the public. This is about the industry bestowing awards on what they think are the best films of the year.\"\\n',\n",

It held off a strong challenge from the new Keanu Reeves sci-fi thriller Constantine which opened at number two with $30.5m (Â£16.1m) Constantine, based on the Hellblazer comics, stars Reeves as an exorcist who must send Satan\\'s minions back to hell. Two family films came next in the chart, with Wayne Wang\\'s comedy Because of Winn-Dixie, about a young girl and an abandoned dog, in third position with $10.85m (Â£5.73m).\\n \\n Comedy adventure Son of the Mask, came in at number four with $7.7m (Â£4.1m), just ahead of Oscar favourite Million Dollar Baby at five.\\n \\n Smith\\'s comedy will be the first US movie released this year to top the $100m (Â£52.7m) mark. It\\'s success continues a strong trend of Hollwood movie-going this year with figures for the popular President\\'s Day weekend 13% greater than last year. Oscar contenders The Aviator, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes and wine-tasting comedy Sideways, both held onto positions in the top 10.\\n',\n",

CSI\\'s co-producer, Carol Mendelsohn, said the episode would have \"more bugs and blood\" than usual. It is not Tarantino\\'s first venture into TV. In 1995 he directed an episode of the medical drama ER and has also appeared in Alias.\\n \\n Ms Mendelsohn said the production team had been trying for a while to get Tarantino to direct an episode of CSI, and added that he was a fan of the forensic drama. She said he finally agreed a few weeks ago while CSI was doing some location shooting in Las Vegas and the show\\'s stars persuaded him. \"He knows everything there is to know about CSI, and he is into the whole mythology of CSI,\" Mendelsohn said. \"Quentin came in a couple of weeks ago. We had a story meeting with the writers. \"He had a great idea, and it was so much fun to have him in the room... we are positively giddy.\" Filming is due to start in early April and the Tarantino-directed episode will be broadcast in the US on 19 May.\\n',\n",
       " 'Bollywood DVD fraudster is jailed\\n \\n A major distributor of pirated DVDs of Bollywood films has been sent to prison for three years.\\n \\n Jayanti Amarishi Buhecha from Cambridge was found guilty of two trademark offences last month, and sentenced at Harrow Crown Court, London, on Tuesday. Buhecha, who made Â£26,000 per month from his illegal trade, was called \"one of the biggest Bollywood pirates in the UK\" by the sentencing judge. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) worked for two years on the case.\\n \\n An operation was launched against Buhecha in 2002 after complaints were received about his activities. The judge in the case, which lasted seven days, said that \"a heavy penalty was called for because of the enormous damage Buhecha caused to legitimate business\". Fake DVDs were manufactured in Pakistan and Malaysia and sold on wholesale to shops by Buhecha, who traded in conterfeit DVDs in 2002 and 2003.\\n \\n In December 2002, he was stopped in his car by trading standards officers, who uncovered 1,000 pirated DVDs and faked inlay cards printed with registered trademarks. Despite being arrested and bailed, Buhecha was caught a second time at the end of 2003. His home and a lock-up in Cambridge were found to contain 18,000 counterfeit DVDs and further faked inlay cards. Buhecha was previously a legitimate distributor of Bollywood films, but was suspended and sued by his employers for dealing in illegal copies of Bollywood classic Mohabbatein. Legitimate Bollywood film distributors have hailed the conviction as \"a major boost\". Bollywood music and film suffers piracy at the rate of 40%, which is more than that suffered by mainstream productions. The BPI welcomed the news of the prison sentence, but warned there are plenty of other active counterfeiters of Bollywood films. The organisation\\'s anti-piracy director David Martin said: \"The problem simply will not disappear with Buhecha. Others and more will take his place, so it\\'s vital that keep up our efforts in this field.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'US \\'afflicted\\' with awards fatigue\\n \\n The film world and media may be wild about the Oscars but cinema-goers and the TV-viewing public are sick of watching award ceremonies, according to some LA film critics.\\n \\n Bob Strauss, from the LA Daily News, thinks there are just too many televised gatherings of stars showering praise on each other. He came up with a colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events, which roughly translates a \"celebrity love-in\". This echoed the views of Oscars host and comedian Chris Rock, who whipped up a media storm for saying he rarely watched them, calling award shows \"idiotic\". \"As Chris Rock accurately said, they\\'re about celebrity and fashion,\" Mr Strauss said. The recent Grammy music awards proved to be a ratings loser, and it seems Oscars organisers are determined not to go the same way.\\n \\n Recently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner.\\n \\n Unsurprisingly, this prompted press speculation that the changes were aimed at boosting flagging advertising revenue. But Entertainment Weekly\\'s Dave Karger maintained the Oscars only generated excitement outside the industry when a blockbuster, such as Titanic or Lord of the Rings, was nominated. The near constant flow of US film awards, representing directors, actors and producers\\' guilds, also means \"few surprises\" are left by the time the Oscar ceremony is upon us, he said. A quick scan of the Los Angeles Times and Los Angeles Daily News bears this out - speculation about who will win seems to have ground to a halt.\\n \\n On Thursday, the Times simply printed a picture of the plastic tents going up outside the Kodak Theatre to protect the red carpet from rain. Variety and the Hollywood Reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industry-related news, while in the UK bets have closed on the best actor category, with Ray star Jamie Foxx a dead cert to win.\\n \\n Screen International\\'s US editor Mike Goodridge thinks 2004\\'s films have simply not grabbed the public\\'s imagination. \"Film-makers haven\\'t produced films that people adore this year,\" he said. \"They adored Saving Private Ryan for example - people loved it and it made a ton of money. \"2004\\'s films could be a reaction to 9/11 - there was a realisation in America that things might not be so rosy after all. \"Audiences don\\'t necessarily want to see darker films such as Million Dollar Baby, Aviator and Finding Neverland, which end with casualty.\" As to whether Rock could pep up the awards, the critics were not hopeful.\\n \\n Mr Strauss doubted whether Rock would make an impact, but added: \"I\\'m all for lower ratings though - there are far more important things going on than the Oscars.\" Mr Karger said the comic might boost younger viewers, but Mike Goodridge thought Rock\\'s humour could prompt America\\'s conservative states to switch off. So despite all this, did the critics have any views on who would win?\\n \\n \"Clint Eastwood\\'s Million Dollar Baby affected people emotionally, which is why it will beat Aviator, which was about technical artistry not feelings,\" Mr Karger said. \"Eastwood has it in the bag,\" added Mr Strauss. \"Oscar voters often vote with their hearts not their heads.\" And Mr Goodridge said best film and director were between Martin Scorsese\\'s Aviator and Million Dollar Baby. Mr Karger, whose favourite film of the year was Mike Leigh\\'s abortion drama Vera Drake, stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments. \"I hope this is the year for small films to triumph,\" he said. \"After all, it\\'s still one of the biggest TV events of the year.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Critics back Aviator for Oscars\\n \\n Martin Scorsese\\'s The Aviator will win best film at the Oscars, according to the UK\\'s leading movie critics.\\n \\n But several of those surveyed by the BBC News website think the veteran film-maker will lose the best director prize to Clint Eastwood. Most of the critics tipped Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank to scoop best actor and actress for Ray and Million Dollar Baby respectively. The jury comprised experts and critics from the top UK film publications. The panel also revealed which nominees they would personally prefer to win.\\n \\n All expect The Aviator to win best film, but many think it will be a close race between Scorsese\\'s Howard Hughes biopic and Eastwood\\'s boxing drama Million Dollar Baby. The other films nominated are wine comedy Sideways, factual drama Finding Neverland, and Ray Charles biopic Ray.\\n \\n \"I\\'m pretty sure this is the year of The Aviator, though my own choice would be Sideways,\" said the Observer\\'s Philip French. \"Sideways should win but it doesn\\'t have a hope,\" said Jamie Graham of Total Film, a position shared by Film 2005 presenter Jonathan Ross. \"The form going in to the Oscars points to The Aviator, but I liked Million Dollar Baby more,\" said Tim Dams, news editor of trade weekly Screen International.\\n \\n Five of the eight critics tipped Scorsese to win best director, with Mr Dams, Heat\\'s Charles Gant and Empire\\'s Angie Errigo plumping for Eastwood. Sideway\\'s Alexander Payne, Ray\\'s Taylor Hackford and British director Mike Leigh - nominated for period drama Vera Drake - are considered outsiders in this category. \"Up until recently I could have sworn Scorsese would get it just for being Scorsese,\" Ms Errigo told the BBC News website. \"But I\\'m beginning to think Eastwood will get it.\"\\n \\n \"I\\'d be very happy for Mike Leigh to win, but I don\\'t think he has any chance,\" said Charles Gant, film editor of Heat. Foxx\\'s portrayal of Ray Charles has already seen him win prizes at the Golden Globes, Baftas and Screen Actors Guild Awards. Mr Dams said this made him \"out-and-out favourite\" to be named best actor on Oscar night. \"Everyone would be incredibly surprised if he didn\\'t win,\" he said. \"If you\\'re a betting man, he\\'s as close as you get to a certainty.\" \"If Paul Giamatti was nominated for Sideways it would be a different game,\" says Total Film\\'s Jamie Graham. \"But Foxx will and should win.\"\\n \\n With Vera Drake star Imelda Staunton nominated for best actress alongside Kate Winslet, Britain has a good chance of victory - on paper. Jonathan Ross, for one, will be very happy if Winslet wins for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. But while Wendy Ide of The Times still thinks Staunton has a chance, Heat\\'s Charles Gant believes her Bafta win will cut little ice with Academy voters. \"I\\'d like Staunton to win, but her chances are not that great,\" said Mr Gant, who predicted a second Oscar for Hilary Swank.\\n \\n \"I think Swank will win,\" said Mr French. \"Imelda has got as far as she\\'s going to get playing that role.\" Staunton is also the personal choice of Steven Gaydos, executive editor of industry magazine Variety. But while he tipped Swank to win, he predicted it would be a close contest. \"Everything has the ability to flip by one vote and go the other way,\" he told the BBC News website. \"There\\'s not a sense that it\\'s obvious how it\\'s going to go.\" Meanwhile, thousands of people have voted in a BBC Radio Five Live poll to find the best film never to have won a best picture Oscar. The audience voted overwhelmingly for The Shawshank Redemption, the 1994 Frank Darabont tale of hope and humanity, which received 52% of the online votes and 68% of the text messages. The other two finalists, Citizen Kane and A Matter of Life and Death split the remaining votes roughly equally.

       " 'Briton wins short film Oscar\\n \\n Three of the five nominees in the live-action short film category at this year\\'s Oscars were British. For Andrea Arnold, who won the category, Ashvin Kumar and Gary McKendry the past month has thrust them from relative obscurity into the limelight.\\n \\n Arnold\\'s gritty drama Wasp is about a single mother living on the breadline, while Kumar\\'s Little Terrorist follows a young Pakistani Muslim boy, who gets stuck on the wrong side of the heavily armed Indian border. McKendry\\'s entry, Everything In This Country Must, forces British soldiers and Catholics to challenge their relationship during the troubles in Northern Ireland. Last week, the trio attended an official screening of all the nominated short films at the Academy\\'s headquarters in Beverly Hills. \"I felt so privileged to have a thousand people watching my film on the biggest screen I\\'ve ever seen,\" says Arnold.\\n \\n Set in her native Dartford, Wasp tells the story of a young mum, who, unable to find a babysitter, leaves her four young daughters outside a pub while she\\'s on a date. The image that sparked the film was that of a wasp crawling into a baby\\'s mouth. \"The other nominees said they made their films for this reason or that - they had something to say. But I just start with an image I can\\'t shake off, work outwards from that and see what comes out,\" she explains.\\n \\n Since she presented children\\'s TV shows Number 73 and Motormouth in the 1980s, Arnold has kept a low profile and is having trouble adapting to this sudden onslaught of attention. \"I\\'m not interested in the publicity. It\\'s not my personality. I\\'m overwhelmed by all the fuss,\" she said.\\n \\n \"It\\'s all a bit like a beauty contest - all the films are great and so different. \"But even though my film has won 30 awards worldwide (including one at Sundance last month), I\\'d still be proud of it - even if it hadn\\'t won any.\" Asked what the nomination means to her, Arnold says she feels \"flattered and honoured\". \"We\\'ve all been overwhelmed by the response and can\\'t get it in perspective yet. I\\'m still reeling.\"\\n \\n And she won\\'t commit to an opinion of Hollywood yet. \"I\\'m just in the middle of it, living moment to moment, day to day.\" But despite her reservations about the Academy Awards and the media frenzy that surrounds it, she accepts that it has opened doors for her. \"People will definitely listen to what I want to do now, and the phone didn\\'t stop ringing for a week after I got nominated.\" As for the future, Arnold firmly believes that you often get a stronger vision of the world with short films. \"You\\'re left more to your own devices, without people interfering as much.\" That said, she is currently working on a feature film with Dogville and Dancer In The Dark director Lars Von Trier.\\n',\n",

It also won acting awards for stars Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen. Sideways is tipped to do well at Sunday's Oscars, with five nominations.\\n \\n The awards, now in their 20th year, are given to films made outside the traditional studio system, and are traditionally held the day before the Oscars. Other winners included Catalina Sandino Moreno, who took best actress for her role as a drug smuggler in the Colombian drama Maria Full of Grace. Moreno is also nominated for best actress at the Oscars. The best first screenplay award went to Joshua Marston for Maria Full of Grace. Scrubs star Zach Braff won the award for best first feature for Garden State, which he wrote, directed and starred in. Oscar-nominated euthanasia film The Sea Inside from Spain won best foreign film, while Metallica: Some Kind Of Monster was awarded best documentary. Actor Rodrigo de la Serna took the best debut performance prize for The Motorcycle Diaries. The awards are voted for by the 9,000 members of the Independent Feature Project/Los Angeles, which includes actors, directors, writers and other industry professionals.

It stars actress Nathalie Press, who appeared in the Bafta-winning drama My Summer Of Love, as a single mother who is forced to take drastic action when she is invited on a date and is unable to find a babysitter to look after her four daughters. The film has already won over 30 other international awards including the Sundance Short Film Prize. Arnold, from Dartford in Kent, described her victory as \"truly overwhelming. I\\'m really not used to this kind of thing,\" she said, after receiving her Oscar from actor Jeremy Irons. \"Thanks to everyone who worked on this - the beers are on me when we get home.\" The director was one of only two British winners on the night, the other being Sandy Powell, who won the costume design Oscar for her work on The Aviator.\\n',\n",

The Aviator took five prizes including best supporting actress for Cate Blanchett. The biopic of Howard Hughes led the nominations with 11. Jamie Foxx picked up best actor for playing soul star Ray Charles in Ray. Many expected this to be Scorsese\\'s year - but he was unsuccessful in the best director category for the fifth time in his career.\\n \\n He has never won despite being nominated for such films as Raging Bull and Goodfellas. Instead, Eastwood took his second Oscar for best director after winning for Unforgiven in 1993. \"It was a wonderful adventure,\" Eastwood said. \"To make a picture in 37 days, it takes a well oiled machine. I am lucky to be here and lucky to be still working.

He thanked Eastwood and described the film as \"a labour of love\". This was the fourth nomination of his career but his first win. Backstage, he said: \"A lot of people say you\\'re due - maybe you are, maybe you aren\\'t - it\\'s an accolade.\" Million Dollar Baby\\'s success was the night\\'s biggest surprise after The Aviator seemed to have the advantage until the end of the ceremony.\\n \\n Cate Blanchett, who won for playing late screen legend Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, said her award was \"an indescribable surprise and honour\". Of Hepburn, she said: \"The longevity of her career is inspiring to everyone.\" Blanchett also paid tribute to the film\\'s director Martin Scorsese, telling him: \"I hope my son will marry your daughter.\" The Aviator\\'s other awards came for cinematography, film editing, art direction and costume design. And Jamie Foxx, who had two nominations this year, paid tribute to the \"beautiful legacy\" of soul legend Ray Charles, who died last year, and thanked director Taylor Hackford. \"You took a chance, man,\" he said. \"That love for Ray Charles was deep down in the earth somewhere and you opened it up. \"Everybody\\'s drowning in this love. Thank you for taking a chance and thank you for waiting 15 years to get me to do it.\"\\n \\n He broke down in tears when speaking about being whipped by his grandmother, whom he described as his first acting teacher, when he was young. In other awards, cartoon hit The Incredibles won best animated feature and best sound editing. Bittersweet comedy Sideways won best adapted screenplay while the original screenplay prize went to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Born into Brothels, about the children of prostitutes in Calcutta, was named best documentary, The Sea Inside was named best foreign language film and Finding Neverland got the accolade for best musical score. Spider-Man 2 triumphed in the visual effects category, Ray won best sound mixing and Lemony Snicket\\'s A Series of Unfortunate Events picked up best make-up. Former British TV presenter Andrea Arnold, who hosted children\\'s shows Motormouth and Number 73 in the 1980s, won best short film for Wasp.

Kate Winslet also lost to best actress Hilary Swank, while Clive Owen and Sophie Okonedo failed to win best supporting actor awards. The UK\\'s Andrea Arnold won the short film award for her gritty drama Wasp.\\n \\n Arnold, who presented children\\'s television shows Number 73 and Motormouth in the 1980s, said it was \"totally overwhelming\" to win. Wasp tells the story of a single mother living on the breadline, beating films by fellow UK nominees Gary McKendry and Ashvin Kumar.\\n \\n \"Everyone worked extremely hard - they know who they are,\" Arnold said as she accepted the prize. \"The beers are on me when we get home.\" Earlier British costume designer Sandy Powell won the Oscar for The Aviator, beating Finding Neverland\\'s UK designer Alexandra Byrne in the process. \"I\\'m very thrilled for the film and all the people who worked with me,\" said Ms Powell. \"Hopefully I\\'ll be staying up to celebrate - I\\'ve been sick for three days and want to make it through the night.\" The British visual effects team behind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban were less fortunate, however, losing the Oscar in that category to Spider-Man 2. Before Sunday\\'s ceremony Owen was bookmakers\\' favourite for his role in romantic drama Closer that had already clinched him a Golden Globe award. It was the first time actress Okonedo had been shortlisted, chosen for her performance in Hotel Rwanda about the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It was also a debut nomination for Staunton, 49, who played abortionist Vera Drake in Mike Leigh\\'s film.\\n \\n Leigh had previously received three Oscar nominations for Secrets and Lies and Topsy Turvy. Winslet said she was \"ecstatic\" about the fourth Oscar nomination of her career, this time for her lead role in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Among other British talent nominated for Oscars, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Charles Hart were nominated for best original song for Learn To Be Lonely, from The Phantom of the Opera movie. That award was won by Al Otro Lado Del Rio from The Motorcycle Diaries. Cinematographer John Mathieson, who was nominated for Gladiator in 2001, was also up for The Phantom of the Opera but lost to The Aviator. Finding Neverland garnered another nomination for British talent, with Gemma Jackson shortlisted for the art direction prize. She lost in that category to The Aviator. A spokesman for the UK Film Council said: \"It is disappointing not to have more British winners.\" He added: \"It was extraordinary to have 24 British nominees in the initial list of nominees.\"\\n',\n",

Paramount Pictures, the studio behind the film, have revealed few details about the project but say it has the potential to spawn a series of films. Lee is best known for his work on Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk.\\n \\n He is collaborating on the script with screenwriter Peter Briggs, who penned the recent comic book adaptation Hellboy. \"We believe it to be truly a whole new franchise,\" said Gill Champion, president and chief executive of Lee\\'s POW!

       " 'Jackson film \\'absolute disaster\\'\\n \\n A PR expert has told the Michael Jackson child abuse trial that the TV documentary at the heart of the case was an \"absolute disaster\".\\n \\n Ann Kite told the court in the Californian town of Santa Maria she was hired to \"crisis manage\" the fallout after the programme had aired in 2003. Jurors saw the film, in which the pop star held hands with the alleged victim, on Tuesday. Mr Jackson denies 10 charges of child abuse and false imprisonment. If convicted, he could face up to 21 years in prison.\\n \\n Ms Kite suggested Jackson\\'s associates had been intent on launching a smear campaign against the accuser\\'s family after the airing of Martin Bashir\\'s film Living with Michael Jackson. She told the court that in the aftermath of the broadcast, a Jackson lawyer had told her the boy\\'s mother would be made to look like a \"crack whore\". Jackson\\'s defence questioned Ms Kite\\'s credibility, pointing that she worked for the singer\\'s team for less than a week before being fired, and had never met or spoken to the star.\\n \\n Ms Kite said she received a phone call on 13 February 2003 from a Jackson associate, Marc Schaffel, who said the boy and his family had left the Neverland ranch where they had been staying.\\n \\n Ms Kite told the court she had later asked Jackson\\'s lawyer, David LeGrand, what had happened. \"I said, `Don\\'t make me believe that these people were hunted down like dogs and brought back to the ranch\\',\" she said. Ms Kite began to work for Mr Jackson in February 2003, after the controversial film was televised in the US and Europe. The documentary sparked a media storm and the subsequent investigation into Mr Jackson\\'s relationship with the boy. In the film, the singer said he did not see anything wrong with sharing a bed with a child.\\n \\n Questioned by the prosecution, Ms Kite said her plan had been to move media coverage of the star away from a focus on his human frailties to concentrate more on his musical genius. Ms Kite said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against Mr Jackson. The Smoking Gun website publication was \"beyond disaster\", Ms Kite said. Correspondents say the reference is important because it was unclear whether the prosecution would be able to bring up the previous case in front of the jury.\\n \\n The judge is studying whether the prosecution\\'s first witness, reporter Martin Bashir, is in contempt of court. The defence protested after Mr Bashir, who interviewed Jackson for the TV documentary, refused to answer nearly all their questions, citing a California \"shield\" law intended to allow journalists to protect their sources. In the prosecution\\'s opening statement on Monday, Tom Sneddon told the court that Mr Jackson had shown the boy porn and plied him with wine, in order to molest him. He said the singer had visited sexually explicit websites and showed the boy - who was 13 at the time - and his younger brother pornography at his ranch.\\n',\n",

The Da Vinci Code is set in Paris - including the Louvre - and has sold around one million copies in France. The main character, Robert Langdon, also appears in Angels and Demons. The Da Vinci Code is being made into a film starring Tom Hanks. Angels and Demons was written before The Da Vinci Code, which has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, and been translated into more than 40 languages, since it was released in 2003. Angels and Demons is set mainly in Rome as symbologist Robert Langdon follows a 400-year-old trail to try to uncover a plot by an ancient brotherhood, The Illuminati, to blow up the Vatican.\\n \\n The novel deals with moral issues such as the debate between science and religion and also seeks to uncover some of the mysteries surrounding the Pope. On his website, Brown wrote: \"I think the reason Angels and Demons is raising eyebrows right now is that it opens some Vatican closets most people don\\'t even know exist. \"But I think most people understand that an organisation as old and powerful as the Vatican could not possibly have risen to power without acquiring a few skeletons in their closets.\" Such is the success of The Da Vinci Code in France, special tours have been organised to trace Langdon\\'s footsteps, including the the Louvre museum and the Saint Sulpice Church.

Directed by John Carpenter, it made over $60m (Â£31.3m) worldwide - a record for independent film at that time. Hill also worked with Carpenter on Escape From New York and The Fog. Born in New Jersey, Hill began her career as a production assistant and worked her way through the ranks, becoming an assistant director and second-unit director before she began collaborating with Carpenter.\\n \\n She was regarded by many as a pioneering woman in film, taking on jobs in the 70s that were more commonly taken by men. \"Back when I started in 1974, there were very few women in the industry,\" she said in 2003. \"I was assumed to be the make-up and hair person, or the script person. I was never assumed to be the writer or producer.\" \"I took a look around and realised there weren\\'t that many women, so I had to carve a niche for myself.\" Carpenter said that working with Hill was \"one of the greatest experiences of my life\". \"The ground that she trailblazed in the beginning can now be followed by anyone. She was incredibly capable and talented,\" he said. Carpenter and Hill collaborated on a number of Halloween sequels, including Halloween II, Halloween: Resurrection and Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers.\\n \\n Later in her career, Hill formed a production company with her friend Lynda Obst, making a string of hit films including Oscar nominee The Fisher King and teen comedy Adventures In Babysitting. Other films included the Stephen King adaptation The Dead Zone in 1983 and 1985\\'s Clue, a comedy based on the board game Cluedo. In the 90s she pursued work in TV, although she was reunited with Carpenter in 1996 for Escape From LA, the sequel to Escape From New York. At the time of her death she was working on a film about the last two men pulled from the rubble of the Twin Towers following the 11 September terror attacks in 2001. She was also co-producing the remake of The Fog, which is due for release early next year.\\n',\n",

The original film, released in 1980, has spawned ten sequels based around mask-wearing murderer Jason Voorhees. The most recent, Freddy Vs Jason, was released in summer 2003. That film saw Jason battle Freddy Krueger, star of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. According to the industry newspaper, New Line had been trying to make another sequel involving Ash, the hero of the Evil Dead movies, but was unable to agree terms with director Sam Raimi. Tarantino is said to be intrigued by the prospect of building a new film around one of the horror genre's most recognised figures.

Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.\\n \\n Ms Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that\\'s the extra Â£1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner\\'s maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\"\\n \\n She said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.\\n \\n Ms Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government\\'s statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said.

Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served \"no current purpose\", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.\\n \\n Tory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was \"too unlikely to have been a coincidence\", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the \"e-mail regime\" could \"support the freedom of information regime\".\\n \\n Mr Thomas said: \"The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.\" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.\\n \\n \"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities.

Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months\\' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\"\\n \\n Ms Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).\\n \\n The minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.\\n \\n \"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\"\\n \\n She added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.\\n \\n It has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.\\n',\n",
       " 'Labour chooses Manchester\\n \\n The Labour Party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in Manchester and not Blackpool, it has been confirmed.\\n \\n The much trailed decision was ratified by Labour\\'s ruling National Executive Committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue. It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.\\n \\n For years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference.\\n \\n Colin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: \"We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. \"Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. \"It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn\\'t want to come to the main working class resort in the country.\" The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.\\n',\n",
       " 'Brown ally rejects Budget spree\\n \\n Chancellor Gordon Brown\\'s closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a Budget giveaway on 16 March.\\n \\n Ed Balls, ex-chief economic adviser to the Treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day. But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.\\n \\n Mr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - \"with a margin to spare\". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.\\n \\n He also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party\\'s chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"If the MPC (the Bank of England\\'s Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I\\'m not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he told a Parliamentary lunch. \"This is a big change in our political culture.\"\\n \\n During an interview with BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown\\'s Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. \"I don\\'t think we\\'ll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,\" he said.\\n \\n His assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers\\' skills. His message to the chancellor was: \"Please don\\'t give it away in any form of electioneering.\" Sir Digby added: \"I don\\'t think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. \"We would say to him \\'don\\'t increase your public spending, don\\'t give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people\\'. \"That would be a good way to spend any excess.\"\\n \\n Mr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. \"I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,\" Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.\\n',\n",
       " '\\'Errors\\' doomed first Dome sale\\n \\n The initial attempt to sell the Millennium Dome failed due to a catalogue of errors, a report by the government\\'s finance watchdog says.\\n \\n The report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the Millennium exhibition ended. The National Audit Office said the Dome cost taxpayers Â£28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. Finally, a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. More than Â£550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in Greenwich, London.\\n \\n The NAO report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the Dome. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said a good deal had been secured. \"Delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the Millennium Village and elsewhere on the peninsula,\" he said. But Edward Leigh, who is chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the Dome deal. He said: \"This report also shows that the first attempt to sell the Dome proved a complete fiasco. Every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. The process was confused and muddled.\" He added: \"Four years after the Millennium Exhibition closed, the Government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that, incredible as it may seem, should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. However, it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt.\" NAO head Sir John Bourn said: \"In difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition, English Partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal.\"\\n',\n",

Dr Fox told BBC Radio: \"If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all.\" He would not discuss reports the party repaid Â£500,000 to Lord Ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat.\\n \\n The prime minister ratcheted up Labour\\'s pre-election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party\\'s spring conference. He insisted he did not know the poll date, but it is widely expected to be 5 May.\\n \\n In what was seen as a highly personal speech in Gateshead on Sunday, Mr Blair said: \"I have the same passion and hunger as when I first walked through the door of 10 Downing Street.\" He described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric, then struggling to live up to the expectations, and reaching the point of raised voices and \"throwing crockery\". He warned his supporters against complacency, saying: \"It\\'s a fight for the future of our country, it\\'s a fight that for Britain and the people of Britain we have to win.\"\\n \\n Mr Blair said that whether the public chose Michael Howard or Mr Kennedy, it would result in \"a Tory government not a Labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward\". Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents\\' policies and then attacking the lies. \"What we learned at the weekend is what Labour tactics are going to be and it\\'s going to be fear and smear,\" he told BBC News. The Tory co-chairman attacked Labour\\'s six new pledges as \"vacuous\" and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. Dr Fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid Â£500,000 to former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election. \"We repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters,\" he said, insisting he enjoyed a \"warm and constructive\" relationship to Lord Ashcroft.\\n \\n Meanwhile Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy is expected to attack Mr Blair\\'s words as he begins a nationwide tour on Monday. Mr Kennedy is accelerating Lib Dem election preparations this week as he visits Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester, Somerset, Basingstoke, Shrewsbury, Dorset and Torbay. He said: \"This is three-party politics. In the northern cities, the contest is between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. \"In southern and rural seats - especially in the South West - the principal contenders are the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, who are out of the running in Scotland and Wales.\" The Lib Dems accuse Mr Blair of making a \"touchy-feely\" speech to Labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.\\n',\n",
       " 'Women MPs reveal sexist taunts\\n \\n Women MPs endure \"shocking\" levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts, a new study shows.\\n \\n Male MPs pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered \"melons\" as women made Commons speeches, researchers from Birkbeck College were told. Labour\\'s Yvette Cooper said she found it hard to persuade Commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary. Some 83 MPs gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study \"Whose Secretary are You, minister\".\\n \\n The research team, under Professor Joni Lovenduski, had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at Westminster. But what emerged was complaints from MPs of all parties of sexist barracking in the Chamber, sexist insults and patronising assumptions about their abilities. Barbara Follet, one of the so-called \"Blair Babes\" elected in 1997, told researchers: \"I remember some Conservatives - whenever a Labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts - imaginary breasts - in their hands and wiggle them and say \\'melons\\' as we spoke.\" Former Liberal Democrat MP Jackie Ballard recalled a stream of remarks from a leading MP on topics such as women\\'s legs or their sexual persuasion. And ex-Tory education secretary Gillian Shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women \"Betty\".\\n \\n \"When I said, \\'Look you know my name isn\\'t Betty\\', he said, \\'ah but you\\'re all the same, so I call you all Betty\\'.\" Harriet Harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the Cabinet: \"Well, you\\'ve only succeeded because you\\'re a woman.\" Another current member of the Cabinet says she was told: \"Oh, you\\'ve had a very fast rise, who have you been sleeping with?\" Even after the great influx of women MPs at the 1997 general election, and greater numbers of women in the Cabinet, female MPs often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world.\\n \\n Liberal Democrat Sarah Teather, the most recent female MP to be elected, told researchers: \"Lots of people say it\\'s like an old boys club. \"I\\'ve always said to me it feels more like a teenage public school - you know a public school full of teenagers.\" Prof Joni Lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of Margaret Moran MP and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings. \"We expected a bit of this but nothing like this extent. We expected to find a couple of shocking episodes.\" But she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the 1997 intake and afterwards. This was mainly because there were more women present in Parliament who were not prepared to \"put up with\" the sexist attitudes they came across, Prof Lovenduski said. But she added: \"Some women, including the women who came in 1997, received extraordinary treatment and I am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back. \"What I think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the House of Commons.\" The interviews are to be placed in the British Library as a historical record.\\n',\n",
       " 'Campbell: E-mail row \\'silly fuss\\'\\n \\n Ex-No 10 media chief Alastair Campbell is at the centre of a new political row over an e-mail containing a four-letter outburst aimed at BBC journalists.\\n \\n Mr Campbell sent the missive by mistake to BBC2\\'s Newsnight after it sought to question his role in Labour\\'s controversial poster campaign. He later contacted the show saying the original e-mail had been sent in error and that it was all a \"silly fuss\". Mr Campbell has recently re-joined Labour\\'s election campaign.\\n \\n The e-mail was revealed the day after Peter Mandelson, former Labour minister and now a European Commissioner, warned the BBC to steer away from \"demonising\" Mr Campbell. Mr Campbell messaged Newsnight after the programme investigated claims that Labour\\'s advertising agency TBWA was blaming him for controversy over its campaign posters. The images, including one of flying pigs and another of what critics claim depicted Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin, prompted accusations of anti-Semitism, claims denied by Labour.\\n \\n Mr Campbell\\'s e-mail, which was apparently intended for a party official, suggested they should get Trevor Beattie, TBWA\\'s boss, to issue a statement. In it, he said: \"Just spoke to trev. think tbwa shd give statement to newsnight saying party and agency work together well and nobody here has spoken to standard. Posters done by by tbwa according to political brief. Now fuck off and cover something important you twats!\" The e-mail was sent by mistake to Newsnight journalist Andrew McFadyen. Realising his error, Mr Campbell then e-mailed Mr McFadyen pointing out the mistake, but suggesting presenter Jeremy Paxman would have seen the funny side.\\n \\n He said: \"Not very good at this e-mail Blackberry malarkey. Just looked at log of sent messages, have realised e-mail meant for colleagues at TBWA has gone to you. For the record, first three sentences of email spot on. No row between me and trevor. \"Posters done by them according to our brief. I dreamt up flying pigs. Pigs not great but okay in the circs of Tories promising tax cuts and spending rises with the same money. TBWA made production. \"Campbell swears shock. Final sentence of earlier e-mail probably a bit colourful and personal considering we have never actually met but I\\'m sure you share the same sense of humour as your star presenter Mr P. \"Never known such a silly fuss since the last silly fuss but there we go. Must look forward not back.\"\\n \\n Later the prime minister\\'s spokesman was asked by journalists about his view on Mr Campbell\\'s use of abusive language. The spokesman said: \"The person you are referring to is capable of speaking for himself and he no longer works in government.\" Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said he had always had \"very good and polite relations\" with Mr Campbell, who he described as \"very talented\". But on the former spin doctor\\'s use of language, Mr Straw said: \"I do know the odd journalist who has occasionally used the odd word that would probably be inappropriate in some circumstances. Maybe I mix with the wrong kind of journalists.\" Liam Fox, Tory co-chairman, said the return of Mr Campbell was a sign of new \"sinister and underhand tactics\" by Labour.\\n',\n",

Scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a super-casino will be built in Scotland. But opposition parties say that will not happen in practice. The vote is due to be taken on Wednesday and is expected to be close.\\n \\n The Scottish Executive believes that the legislation should be handled by Westminster. The new law will control internet gambling for the first time and is aimed at preventing children from becoming involved. A super-casino in Glasgow could be located at Ibrox or the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. The new gambling bill going through Westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public, have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes. But the Scottish National Party and the Tories say the issue of super-casinos should be decided in Scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility.\\n',\n",

Mr Howard will host a news conference at the party\\'s London HQ every morning, Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said. \"We want Michael to be as accessible as possible,\" Mr Fox said, adding that the party was not afraid of scrutiny.\\n \\n The Tory leader wanted to meet as many ordinary members of the public, Mr Fox said. Tony Blair has also said he is intending to get out and talk to as many people as possible during the election campaign. But Labour campaign chiefs say there are no plans for Mr Blair to hold a daily news conference.\\n \\n Mr Fox responded by accusing the prime minister of \"hiding away from the scrutiny of London\\'s media\". The Liberal Democrats also say they are planning to hold daily news conferences with Charles Kennedy. On Mrs Howard\\'s role, Mr Fox said: \"Sandra has already been campaigning with Michael on a number of visits and has been undertaking short visits herself. \"That pattern will continue. It\\'s worked very well up until now.\" Mrs Howard made her debut speech at the Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth last October. She used her speech on the fringe to highlight the work of a drugs charity, Addaction, which she supports. Mrs Howard has also appeared along side her husband on TV chat shows. During an interview on ITV1\\'s This Morning she said she often criticised her husband for not showing the side of him that she knows.\\n',\n",
       " 'PM apology over jailings\\n \\n Tony Blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the UK\\'s biggest miscarriages of justice.\\n \\n The prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for IRA bomb attacks on pubs in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974. Mr Blair said: \"I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice.\" He made the apology to members of the Conlon and Maguire families in his private room at Westminster. In a statement recorded for television, Mr Blair said the families deserved \"to be completely and publicly exonerated\".\\n \\n The families had hoped the apology would be made during Prime Minister\\'s Questions in the House of Commons. However, one of the so-called Guildford Four, Gerry Conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology. He said Mr Blair had spoken with \"such sincerity\", adding: \"He went beyond what we thought he would, he took time to listen to everyone. \"You could see he was moved by what people were saying. \"Tony Blair has healed rifts, he is helping to heal wounds. It\\'s a day I never thought would come.\" The move followed a huge campaign in Ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the IRA bombs which killed seven people. Mr Blair\\'s official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would \"ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister\\'s statement brought to them\".\\n \\n Most of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. All were arrested because of a family connection to Gerry Conlon. Mr Conlon\\'s father Giuseppe was arrested when travelling to London from Belfast to help his son. He died while serving his sentence. Also arrested were Anne Maguire and members of her family. Mrs Maguire was the relative with whom Giuseppe planned to stay in London, as well as two family friends. She said it was a \"wonderful feeling\" to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.\\n \\n \"The people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent,\" she said. They were all jailed for handling explosives, based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. In October 1989 the Court of Appeal quashed the sentences of the Guildford Four, and in June 1991 it overturned the sentences on the Maguire Seven. Mr Conlon\\'s case was highlighted in the Oscar-nominated film In The Name Of The Father, starring Daniel Day-Lewis.\\n',\n",
       " 'Howard rebuts asylum criticisms\\n \\n Tory leader Michael Howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas.\\n \\n Mr Howard, whose parents fled the Nazi threat to come to the UK, says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. His comments come in a BBC documentary called \\'No More Mr Nasty\\'. TV presenter Anne Robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would \"like to kick your cat\". Ms Robinson, a friend of the Tory leader, also revealed that as a Cambridge student Mr Howard was \"much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover\" - although she denied having personal experience. \"I wasn\\'t at Cambridge - and it\\'s not personal experience - but I know people who were.\"\\n \\n Documentary maker Michael Cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to Mr Howard for his film portrait. The Tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s, his parents might not have been allowed into the country.\\n \\n He replies: \"What is the inference of that? \"That if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you\\'re not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants? \"That seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition? It would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister.\"\\n \\n Ms Robinson, who presents The Weakest Link tells Cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in John Major\\'s government. \"I used to have to sit on my hands because he\\'d get on television and give a passable impression of someone who\\'d like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. I mean it was very, very Draconian.\" The film shows Mr Howard laughing at Rory Bremner\\'s impression of him as Dracula, which he calls \"good fun\", apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the UK. The film shows the private side of the Tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife, ex-model Sandra. Asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses: \"Yeah, it would be more enjoyable if I could win occasionally too, but otherwise it\\'s quite fun.\"\\n \\n Former Downing Street communications chief Alastair Campbell, now working on Labour\\'s election campaign, says a \"touchy-feely\" image does not fit Mr Howard. He says Tony Blair was not worried by his opponents\\' early performance in their Commons clashes because Mr Howard lacked a \"big strategy\", including on issues like Iraq. The Tory leader brands such criticisms as \"absolutely rubbish\", arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of Mr Blair\\'s failure to tell the truth on intelligence. Former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke says Mr Howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the Tory party than his personal image. Mr Clarke says the party is improving and it is \"conceivable\" it could win the next election. But he adds: \"It has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal.\"\\n \\n - Michael Howard: No More Mr Nasty is being shown on BBC2 on Saturday 12 February at 2005 GMT.\\n',\n",
       " 'Blair rejects Tory terror offer\\n \\n Tony Blair has rejected a Conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of anti-terror legislation.\\n \\n The Tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the Anti-Terrorism Bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in November. Mr Blair said the bill, which brings in house arrest for terror suspects, had time limiting safeguards already. The Tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed. The Lib Dems also oppose the plans.\\n \\n The government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases.\\n \\n Mr Blair\\'s refusal to accept the Tories\\' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the Lords. Peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on Thursday. The bill proposes \"control orders\", which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. These would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights.\\n \\n The Tories want judicial oversight of all control orders, not just house arrest. Shadow Home Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio Four\\'s the World at One his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice. He said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a \"recruiting sergeant\" for terrorists. He went on to say: \"If we don\\'t get the amendments we regard as essential, including the sunset clause, we will vote against the bill.\" In the Commons, Mr Howard said it would be \"far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so Parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through\". Mr Blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable.\\n \\n The second, less stringent, type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a three-monthly report on their use by \"an eminent and independent person\". \"I believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that I will not put at risk,\" said Mr Blair. The Lib Dems plan to oppose the Bill in the Lords on Thursday. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"There\\'s a lot of talking left. I would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months.\" A spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch said it was a \"basic principle\" that people should only be punished after a fair trial. She added: \"Having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either.\"\\n',\n",

In October, Mr Straw and his Spanish counterpart Miguel Moratinos agreed to establish a body that would give Gibraltarians a voice in their future. Most Gibraltarians said in a referendum they wanted to remain British.\\n \\n Gibraltar's Chief Minister Peter Caruana will represent the British citizens living on the Rock, while Britain's Europe Director Dominick Chilcott will represent the UK. Madrid is being represented by Spain's director general for Europe, Jose Maria Pons.

The committee was reporting on the work, strategy and spending plans of the Economic Social Research Council.\\n \\n The council aims to promote and support strategic research for social science postgraduates and provide social scientists to meet the needs of the country. It also liaises with the government and industry over their social science needs. In its report on the council\\'s work the committee said: \"We are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting, in particular, the qualitative branches of social sciences. This mirrored previous concerns the committee had expressed on shortages in the fields of maths and chemistry, it said. \"It is hard to see how significant progress towards rectifying these shortages can be made through the deployment of Economic and Social Research Council\\'s limited resources. \"If the government is serious about addressing skills shortages in key subjects it needs to find a more effective mechanism to achieve this.\" A national \"strategic capabilities fund\" to address shortages in key areas should be set up in response, the committee added.\\n',\n",

The deal is thought to have been hammered out on Thursday night after Japan, one of the biggest creditor nations, finally signed up to it.

Between 1.1 and 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, were killed at Auschwitz. The Tories said they were glad Mr Straw had been \"shamed\" into going, having earlier criticised the decision to send a lower-ranking official. Shadow Foreign Secretary Michael Ancram said: \"I am glad the foreign secretary has finally been shamed into representing Britain at this important act of commemoration. \"Once again this government has shown crass insensitivity until it has been forced by public opinion into doing what it should have done in the first place.\"\\n \\n In Britain, the Queen and Prince Philip will lead the nation\\'s commemoration at a service in Westminster Hall, London. The Queen will also host a reception for holocaust survivors at St James\\'s Palace. Altogether, some six million people, mainly Jews, perished in the Holocaust. The Queen\\'s grandson, Prince Harry, sparked outrage earlier this week after photographs of him wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party emerged. The prince, 20, apologised, but critics have called for him to go to Auschwitz for the commemoration of the Soviets\\' 1945 liberation of the camp. Prince Harry should see for himself \"the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear\", Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of Jewish human rights group the Simon Wiesenthal Center said.\\n',\n",

The media attention had helped to move the focus from Scotland\\'s binge drinking problems, Mr Law said. Scotsman journalist Hamish MacDonell said he believed the bigger picture had been \"obscured\" by the remark. Mr McConnell was speaking on Monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions.\\n \\n The one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the Scottish National Party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were \"a recognition that people will get drunk\". Mr MacDonell, political editor of The Scotsman, said: \"I think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister. \"If you come out with something like this, saying that by all means get drunk, then you will be pilloried for it.\" However, he added that \"perhaps Mr McConnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage\".\\n \\n Mr MacDonell said: \"I think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking. \"But that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. I understand why, but I think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured.\" Mr Law, from voluntary body Alcohol Focus Scotland, believed damage had been done to Scotland\\'s fight against binge drinking. He said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink. Mr Law added: \"I think the remark was ill-advised - but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in Scotland.\\n \\n \"We don\\'t want to preach to young people, but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically. \"This diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness.\" He said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk. Mr MacDonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were \"off the mark\", they were bound to \"come back and bite him\". He added: \"Here, Mr McConnell was talking in the Highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the Scottish Executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters. \"I think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark.\"\\n \\n The Scottish National Party\\'s Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Mr McConnell on Tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his \"ill-judged comment\" and withdraw it immediately. In a furious response, the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context. He told Ms Sturgeon: \"It is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that I \\'should encourage young people to get drunk\\'. \"That is completely untrue. Perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position, undermine the convener of education at Highland Council and insult the intelligence of the young people I spoke with - all for the sake of a simple soundbite.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Concerns at school diploma plan\\n \\n Final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for England\\'s secondary schools put forward by the Tomlinson report.\\n \\n The government\\'s response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week. Some are worried it could be scuppered if, as Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly have suggested, GCSEs and A-levels stay. Sir Mike Tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday. \"It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response,\" said the chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman.\\n \\n His main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications. \"We must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system,\" he wrote in the Times Educational Supplement. \"It is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak.\" The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also told the government not to \"compromise\". The QCA said the potential \"step-change in participation and attainment\" lay in the integrity of the whole diploma. \"Any partial implementation of the proposals would, in our view, compromise that integrity,\" said its chairman, Sir Anthony Greener. It is a sign of the QCA\\'s concern that its advice went to ministers last December but was publicised only recently. But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills. They may be content if it does not \"close too many doors\" in writing - whatever spin is put on it.\\n \\n The chief inspector of schools, David Bell, also said recently that GCSEs and A-levels should go. \"One of the reasons why I\\'m so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it\\'s good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system,\" he said. \"If we don\\'t say this is a sea-change in education, we will miss a great opportunity.\" Universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the Tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. A note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers\\' organisation, the CBI, which complains of a lack of skills. In an attempt to address this, the Tomlinson plan is for tests in \"functional\" maths and literacy - decidedly not GCSEs. It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms\\' concerns on this score. Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinson\\'s predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a \"massive upheaval\". The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.\\n',\n",

And that would be central to Labour\\'s next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.\\n \\n He told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"No politician should make the mistake that John Major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing.\\n \\n \"That is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do.\" Mr Brown insisted his spending plans were \"affordable\" and he could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the \"cornerstone\" of Labour\\'s programme.\\n \\n In a speech at Edinburgh\\'s Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months \"a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term\".\\n \\n \"In every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. All of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,\" Mr Blair said. In his pre-Budget report, Mr Brown surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. Many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. Carl Emmerson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News: \"He thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be OK. We\\'re not so sure.\" David Page, of Investec Securities, said: \"His forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of Â£8bn is way too optimistic. \"It\\'s going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets.\"\\n \\n Conservative Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: \"I can\\'t find a single economic forecaster from the IMF to the Institute of Fiscal Studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. \"In order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election.\" Mr Letwin accused the chancellor of using \"fancy statistics\" to hide public service failures. Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, called on Mr Brown to open up the government\\'s books to the National Audit Office, to see if he had met his \"golden rule\". \"It is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending,\" Mr Cable told MPs.\\n',\n",
       " 'Nat Insurance to rise, say Tories\\n \\n National Insurance will be raised if Labour wins the next election, Tory leader Michael Howard has claimed.\\n \\n Tony Blair has said he does not want higher tax rates for top earners but on Wednesday said other tax promises would be left to Labour\\'s manifesto. Prime minister\\'s questions also saw Mr Blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration. He attacked Tory plans to process asylum claims abroad - but Mr Howard said Labour had proposed the idea too.\\n \\n The Commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign. The Tories have promised Â£4bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall. Mr Howard pointed to the Institute for Fiscal Studies\\' predictions that Labour will need to increase taxes to cover an Â£11bn gap in its spending plans. He accused ministers of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in schools and on slow asylum processing. It was no good Mr Blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to MPs on Tuesday about the top rate of income tax, argued Mr Howard. Pointing to national insurance, he added: \"Everyone knows tax will go up under Labour: isn\\'t it now clear which tax it would be?\"\\n \\n Mr Blair instead hailed Labour\\'s achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services. \"When we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals, that money is not wasted,\" he said. On the tax questions, he added: \"We will make commitments on tax at the time of the manifesto.\" Home Secretary Charles Clarke this week published plans for a new points system for economic migrants, with only high-skilled workers allowed into the UK from outside the European Union.\\n \\n Mr Blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration, where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers, would end. That would probably create a fall in the migrant numbers, he said. The prime minister ridiculed the Tory plans for asylum quotas and for processing all asylum claims overseas. He challenged the Tories on which country would house their processing centres - what he called a \"fantasy island\". Mr Howard read from a letter about the government\\'s own plans at the European Council of Ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the EU. But Mr Blair said: \"All the other countries could not agree on the way forward, nor could the UN.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'E-University \\'disgraceful waste\\'\\n \\n A failed government scheme to offer UK university courses online has been branded a \"disgraceful waste\" by MPs.\\n \\n The e-University was scrapped last year, having attracted only 900 students at a cost of Â£50m. Chief executive John Beaumont was paid a bonus of Â£44,914, despite a failure to bring in private sector backers. The Commons education select committee called this \"morally indefensible\" but the government said the e-University project had \"improved understanding\".\\n \\n A Department for Education and Skills spokeswoman said the venture had been \"ambitious and ground-breaking, but take-up had not been \"sufficient to continue with the project\". She added: \"UK e-Universities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom.\" The select committee found that those responsible for founding the e-University in 2000 had been caught up in the \"general atmosphere of enthusiasm\" surrounding the internet. Initial business plans forecast a quarter of a million students joining within a decade, bringing in at least Â£110m in profit.\\n \\n But virtually no market research was carried out and just Â£4.2m was spent on worldwide sales and marketing of courses. Some Â£14m went on developing the technology to make the e-University work. This was used by just 200 students, the rest preferring to work through existing university websites. With no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister, the e-University had had \"too much freedom to spend public money as it wished\", the report found. Committee chairman Barry Sheerman said: \"UK e-University was a terrible waste of public money. \"The senior executives failed to interest any private investors and showed an extraordinary over-confidence in their ability to attract students to the scheme.\" The report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the e-University, but \"should learn the lessons from this disaster\".\\n',\n",

He will see an HIV/Aids orphanage in Tanzania and a women\\'s credit union in Mozambique before chairing a meeting of the Commission for Africa in Cape Town. At slums in Narobi on Wednesday, he said education needs had to be tackled.\\n \\n Speaking outside the Olympic Primary School, Mr Brown said: \"It is simply not acceptable in the modern age for the rest of the world to stand by and have hundreds of millions of children not getting the chance at education.\" He pointed to international plans to invest $10bn for education in Africa over the next decade. The school is on the edge of Kibera, where 800,000 live often in huts made of mud, scrap metal and cardboard. Mr Brown\\'s aides say he wants to find out more about the Kenyan Government\\'s education policies, which included introducing free primary education in early 2003. The chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a G8 aid package which he has likened to the Marshall Plan used by the United States to rebuild Europe after World War Two. The trip follows claims of infighting between Mr Brown and Tony Blair detailed in a new book. Conservative leader Michael Howard is expected to seize on those reports at prime minister\\'s questions at 1200 GMT on Wednesday.\\n',\n",

She said this would counter \"so-called independent\" groups like Migration Watch, which she described as an anti-immigration body posing as independent. Migration Watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the organisation, says there is no need for an independent body because Office of National Statistics data are accurate. He says he opposes large-scale immigration \"both on the grounds of overcrowding and culture\".\\n \\n He said: \"For example, over the next 20 years one household in three will be due to immigration. \"We are already more overcrowded than India and we are four times more overcrowded than France.\" Ms Roche, Labour MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, believes legal migration is something we should welcome. She said her proposals mean \"we wouldn\\'t have so-called independent experts, like Migration Watch, who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view.\" She went on: \"What I would like to see is there being a body which actually looked at the figures, published them, and was independent of government. \"I think that would go a long way to allaying some of the fears that are sometimes whipped up during this debate.\"\\n',\n",

The announcement followed the final meeting of the commission - which includes singer Bob Geldof - in London. As well as more aid, fairer trade and less debt, the commission is likely to demand action on corruption in Africa. Mr Blair told a news conference: \"It will be a report that\\'s brutally frank about the reality, but I hope idealistic about what can be done if the will is there. \"It\\'s an ambitious project we have set ourselves and you will have to judge on its outcome when we publish it.\"\\n \\n Mr Blair has vowed to put Africa at the top of his agenda during his time at the helm of the G8. He acknowledged he would have a \"a job of persuading to do\" on other nations to get the necessary commitment to debt relief. Bob Geldof, in characteristically blunt style, promised that the commission would not just be a talking shop but would deliver radical new thinking to change direction for Africa. The former rock star\\'s presence on the commission has been interpreted as a sign that it will be uncompromising in its demands. The people involved include two African government leaders and a range of other African politicians, as well as experts from some other developed countries.\\n',\n",
       " 'Butler launches attack on Blair\\n \\n Former civil service chief Lord Butler has criticised the way Tony Blair\\'s government operates, accusing it of being obsessed with headlines.\\n \\n He also attacked the way the Iraq war was \"sold\" to the public, with important warnings on the strength of the intelligence left out. Tory leader Michael Howard said Lord Butler had given the \"most damaging testimony\" he could remember. But Downing Street said Mr Blair should be judged by results not his style.\\n \\n Lord Butler said Mr Blair bypassed the Cabinet and relied instead on small, informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions. The prime minister\\'s official spokesman said the Cabinet was still used to achieve a consensus on important issues. But he added: \"You cannot, in a modern government, take every decision in Cabinet. It\\'s just not possible.\"\\n \\n Lord Butler said the government had too much freedom to \"bring in bad Bills\" and \"to do whatever it likes\" and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees. The former cabinet secretary said in an interview with The Spectator magazine: \"I would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling, there is too much central control and there is too little of what I would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments.\" Mr Howard described Lord Butler\\'s intervention as \"very important\". \"This is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the Blair government. \"It is certainly the most damaging testimony I can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position.\"\\n \\n Lord Butler\\'s report earlier this year into Iraq intelligence said the government\\'s September 2002 weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was \"very thin\". The reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers\\' case for war, Lord Butler said in his Spectator interview, which was conducted by the magazine\\'s editor, Conservative MP Boris Johnson. He said: \"When civil servants give material to ministers, they say these are the conclusions we\\'ve drawn, but we\\'ve got to tell you the evidence we\\'ve got is pretty thin. \"Similarly, if you are giving something to the United Nations and the country you should warn them.\"\\n \\n Asked why he thought the warnings were not there Lord Butler said: \"One has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was. The purpose of the dossier was to persuade the British why the government thought Iraq was a very serious threat.\"\\n \\n When asked whether he thought the country was well-governed on the whole, he replied: \"Well. I think we are a country where we suffer very badly from Parliament not having sufficient control over the executive, and that is a very grave flaw. \"We should be breaking away from the party whip. The executive is much too free to bring in a huge number of extremely bad Bills, a huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes - and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow. \"All that is part of what is bad government in this country.\" Lord Butler\\'s assessment was backed by his predecessor as Cabinet Secretary, Lord Armstrong. Lord Armstrong told BBC Two\\'s Newsnight: \"I agree ... there doesn\\'t appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decision-making that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect.\" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Menzies Campbell said he thought Lord Butler\\'s comments were \"well justified\" and Mr Blair\\'s style of leadership was \"corrosive of the whole system of government\". But Labour former minister Jack Cunningham accused Lord Butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming Labour administration, when he was cabinet secretary. Mr Cunningham told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"Taken together, Robin Butler\\'s comments are partial, inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the Labour government.\"\\n',\n",

But he could not say whether Mr Blunkett had treated the nanny as a special case or had used her as an example of immigration problems. Lib Dem spokesman Mark Oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying. He told BBC News: \"I\\'m extremely concerned that 20 individuals appear to have forgotten what happened or more suspiciously are not prepared to say what happened. \"That must be bad for government, it must be bad for public confidence in the system.\"\\n \\n Mr Oaten said people would be mystified why Sir Alan\\'s inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up. He said: \"There is a strong case for a judge-led judicial review of this because, of course, next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. It may be about something even more important than that. \"So we do need to understand what took place and who was involved.\" The Tories criticised the Lib Dem stance, saying Mr Oaten had initially said he accepted Mr Blunkett\\'s word unless further evidence emerged. But Lib Dem officials say Mr Oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement.\\n',\n",

Other diplomatic posts are being turned over to local staff. Mr Straw said the move would save Â£6m a year to free up cash for priorities such as fighting terrorism.\\n \\n Honorary consuls will be appointed in some of the areas affected by the embassy closures. Nine consulates or consulates general will also be closed, mostly in Europe and America.\\n \\n They include Dallas in the US, Bordeaux in France and Oporto in Portugal, with local staff replacing UK representation in another 11. The changes are due to be put in place before the end of 2006, with most savings made from cutting staff and running costs. Some of the money will have to be used to fund redundancy payments. In a written statement, Mr Straw said: \"The savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office\\'s strategic priorities, including counter- proliferation, counter-terrorism, energy and climate change. \"Some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts. \"In Africa, for instance, we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region, with a new post in Nairobi to help support our work on climate change, one in Nigeria to cover energy and one in Pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering Maseru and Mbabane.\"\\n \\n The Foreign Office currently has about 6,100 UK-based staff. It has opened major new missions on Baghdad and Basra in Iraq, Kabul in Afghanistan and Pyongyang in North Korea since 1997 in response to what the government says are changing needs. Since 1997 10 overseas posts have been closed - excluding Wednesday\\'s cuts - but 18 new embassies or consulates have been opened. The shake-up is aimed at helping making Â£86m in efficiency savings between 2005 and 2008. The chancellor has demanded all government departments make similar savings. Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said there was a constant need to ensure value for money from foreign missions. \"But the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic changes it has announced and must show that British commercial interests and the interests of Britons abroad will not be adversely affected,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Labour targets \\'hardcore truants\\'\\n \\n A fresh crackdown on persistent truants in England has been launched by Education Secretary Ruth Kelly.\\n \\n Serial truants make up one in 13 pupils. Previous initiatives brought 40,000 pupils back to school since 1997, according to official statistics. Parenting contracts, penalty notices and \"fast track\" prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem. It is thought that nearly half a million children skip school each day. Tories say Labour\\'s previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence, where parents are permitted to take children out of school. Such absences are often due to family holidays.\\n \\n However, serial truants avoid the classroom despite government schemes costing Â£885m. Those missing classes are more likely to become involved in crime as well as failing academically. Measures such as parenting contracts and penalty notices were adopted by most local education authorities last term and come into force in the remainder this term. In one local education authority alone 800 parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child\\'s attendance improved. The tough stance paid off with just 24 issued, while attendance improved in 776 cases. Truancy has been reduced by 5% at the 128 worst hit schools through the government\\'s Behaviour Improvement Programme. This is the equivalent of 200 pupils back in classes since September.\\n \\n The new measures come on top of national truancy sweeps - the sixth of which will take place on Monday. Police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school. Held twice each year, in addition to routine local patrols, previous country-wide sweeps have apprehended 31,000 pupils dodging school. In almost 14,000 of those cases, the youngsters were accompanied by their parents. A Department for Education and Skills source said: \"Every day in school counts. \"It is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation\\'s truancy.\"\\n',\n",

He said the review would look at partial defences to murder, including provocation and at mandatory sentences. The Home Office has already said the review will begin next year.\\n \\n On Wednesday, a Home Office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only England and Wales. News of the review was released because it was thought Mr Blunkett would make the official announcement in a Commons debate on Wednesday. But the announcement never came, with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage. Amid opposition anger, Mr Blunkett had to answer an emergency question in Parliament on Thursday. He said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated. Shadow home secretary David Davis welcomed his \"gracious apology\" and the review itself. But he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be \"dragged\" to face MPs.\\n \\n In its report, the Law Commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder. The panel suggested different kinds of murders could be \"graded\" to recognise the seriousness of the offence.\\n \\n But the Home Office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility. The commission, an independent body including two judges, a senior barrister and sentencing experts, had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases. But it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law. Results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 - among them 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was \"indefensible and should cease\".\\n \\n A key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings. The commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence. But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: \"Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence. \"Where an offender is convicted of murder, the court must pass a life sentence.\" The commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge, such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.\\n',\n",

They have agreed to keep to a demonstration site on the other side of the River Tyne from the conference venue in Gateshead. A bid to overturn the law banning hunting with dogs in England and Wales has begun in the Court of Appeal. The ban comes into force on 18 February. The Court of Appeal is expected to rule early next week on whether the alliance\\'s challenge has succeeded. Richard Dodd, regional director of the Countryside Alliance, said he expected between 2,000 and 4,000 supporters in Tyneside to make their protest, with hunt horns and placards.\\n \\n Campaigners have been asked not to bring any animals or alcohol.\\n \\n Mr Dodd said he did not believe there would be any repeat of the trouble which marred the pro-hunt demonstration outside Parliament in September. \"We are holding a static demonstration, just to remind Labour that we are not going away,\" he said. Northumbria Police said the pedestrian Millennium Bridge, by the demonstration site, will be shut if necessary. But Assistant Chief Constable David Warcup has liaised with several protest groups and said all negotiations had gone well. Fathers 4 Justice, pensioners\\' rights activists and Stop the War campaigners were also expected to demonstrate during the three-day conference which starts on Friday. Pro-hunt campaigners claims the 1949 Parliament Act - which extends the right of the House of Commons to overrule the House of Lords - was itself invalid because it was never passed by peers. The High Court last month ruled the act was valid and the proposed hunting ban was lawful. Pro-hunt supporters formally launched their second legal challenge to the ban in London\\'s High Court on Thursday. The Countryside Alliance has lodged papers seeking a judicial review on human rights grounds. Animal welfare groups have welcomed the ban, many of whom have campaigned for a ban for decades saying hunting is cruel and unnecessary.\\n',\n",

Opponents say the Â£2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from Heathrow and Gatwick was used. They said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. BAA are also owners of the airports at Heathrow and Gatwick. They have said they cannot raise the money needed for the Stansted upgrades from current landing charges. BAA also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.\\n \\n Groups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. Their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at Luton Airport, or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at Heathrow. If the group wins, the government\\'s future aviation plans outlined in last year\\'s transport White Paper could be left in ruins.\\n \\n The campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports, such as one planned for the Isle of Sheppey east of London. Lord Hanningfield, leader of Essex County Council, told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"We are going to the High Court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry. \"We want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation, consultation and thought before the government came out with its Green Paper. \"Then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go.\" He added: \"Politicians should not decide where runways should be.\" The Stansted expansion, apart from the building of the new runway, would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.\\n \\n The airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the UK. But BAA has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. BAA is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. At Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.\\n',\n",

Mr Howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying: \"It is not householders who should be frightened, it\\'s the burglars.\" Home Secretary Charles Clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.\\n \\n Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens last month backed a Tory attempt to change the law so only householders using \"grossly disproportionate\" force could be prosecuted. The pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and Crown Prosecution Service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. He told MPs: \"If we get the right response from those people, we will, of course, support a change in the law.\" Instead, the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. On Thursday, Mr Howard told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme Mr Blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. He said: \"We\\'ve had three policy positions in three months and two U-turns. \"It\\'s not surprising Gordon Brown told him: \\'There\\'s nothing you could say to me now that I could ever believe.\\'\"\\n \\n Mr Howard said the \"grossly disproportionate\" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. The issue entered the public spotlight when Norfolk farmer Tony Martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm. But the home secretary said Mr Howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. The barrister who had represented Mr Martin had said the rules were \"weighted overwhelmingly\" in favour of the householder, said Mr Clarke. He said: \"The problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point Sir John Stevens was making and the prime minister was making.\" The new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue, added Mr Clarke. The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. Those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar, tied him up, beat him and set him alight, he said. Tory MP Patrick Mercer\\'s private member\\'s bill to change the law received a first reading in Parliament on Wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.\\n',\n",
       " 'Leaders meet over Turkish EU bid\\n \\n Tony Blair has met Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to talk about Turkey entering the EU.\\n \\n The Downing Street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an EU summit in Brussels later in the week. Mr Blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring Turkey within the recently-expanded EU. Italy and Germany also favour an early start to talks, but there is scepticism in France and elsewhere. Some are worried that Turkey\\'s large and rapidly growing population and low average income might make integration into the EU difficult.\\n \\n Some are concerned that a change of government could lead to Turkey reneging on key human rights reforms it has recently enacted. And many in France would prefer Turkey to admit that World War I-era killing of Armenians constituted genocide. There are also issues in France and the Netherlands over the possible problems of integrating the first major Muslim nation into the EU. But Mr Blair and the Labour government have been the staunchest backers of Turkish accession, provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform. Mr Blair\\'s official spokesman said: \"The prime minister has regular meetings with both of them and particularly in advance of European Councils. \"The key issue at this week\\'s council will be that of Turkey, but they will also discuss a range of other matters.\"\\n',\n",

He said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll. On the Asian tsunami he said it had been \"very heartening\" to learn of the generosity being shown by Britons. Mr Kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster, which had dominated the Christmas and New Year period. At home he said many people were turning to the Liberal Democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.\\n \\n The general election would be a three-party struggle, as the Conservative party \"fades away\" as a national force and the Liberal Democrats challenge Labour in its heartlands, he said. \"A clear division is emerging in British politics - the politics of fear versus the politics of hope. \"Labour is counting on the politics of fear, ratcheting up talk of threats, crime and insecurity. While the Conservatives are re-working their populist scares about asylum and the European \\'menace\\',\" he said. He said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties.\\n \\n It was already using detention without trial at Belmarsh Prison, ignoring a recent Law Lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights, he said. He also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury, plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials, curbing of rights to protest, increased stop and search powers and ID card plans. He said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination. \"But at the same time, an overmighty state is a dangerous one,\" he said. His party \"instinctively\" understood the \"new liberal Britain\" which is no longer a nation with one family structure, and one colour, he said. \"We are less deferential; more inclined to think for ourselves; more open about sexuality and equality. \"Our national institutions are changing too. We are no longer a nation of one church; we are a nation of many faiths. In our attitudes and the way we live our lives, this is in many ways a liberal Britain.\"\\n',\n",

Prior to working for Mr Blair, David Miliband spent time at the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. He then became secretary of the Commission on Social Justice.

Anne Borthwick, of Campaign for Borders Rail, said reopening the Waverley Line would restore the area\\'s prosperity.

Campaigners have said that reopening the Waverley Line, which could cost up to Â£100m, would be a huge economic boost for the Borders.\\n \\n In 2000, Borders Council said the area\\'s economy had suffered since the closure. Ms Borthwick said the lobby group was determined to keep the pressure on the Scottish Executive. \"We are hoping that many people will join us in a march to mark the 36th anniversary of the closure of the Waverley Line,\" she said. \"Campaign for Borders Rail is the biggest independent lobby group in Scotland and we have been lobbying tirelessly for the reinstatement of rail services to the Borders and eventually to Carlisle.\\n \\n \"We believe that it is time for the Scottish Executive to commit to the first phase of the project by pledging to fund the line between Edinburgh and Tweedbank in the first instance and then investigate extending the line in the future.\" Ms Borthwick said reopening the line would be a prosperous move and protect the character of the Scottish Borders. A study in 2000, which was commissioned by the executive, Scottish Borders Council, Midlothian Council and Scottish Borders Enterprise, found that a half-hourly service from Tweedbank to Edinburgh could cover its operating costs.

Culture Minister Alun Pugh said it would be \"crass and ignorant\" to liken a quango review to Hitler\\'s Germany. But Ms James emphasised she had actually said artists needed freedom. The future of the Arts Council of Wales has been in question since it was announced that most Welsh quangos would eventually be abolished.\\n \\n It was announced last July that three Welsh quangos, education and training body Elwa, the Wales Tourist Board and the Welsh Development Agency, would be brought under assembly government control. The Arts Council of Wales may be among the next to come under the assembly government\\'s umbrella. But Ms James, who won the Â£30,000 Jerwood painting prize in 2003, said arts funding should be separate from government. Ms James told BBC Radio Wales: \"It\\'s quite dangerous when you involve politicians because it\\'s not like the health service and it\\'s not like the railways. \"Free expression is absolutely vital in a democratic society. You need distance, you do not need government interference because it could be taken the wrong way.\"\\n \\n But she said reports that she had likened the assembly government to totalitarian regimes were inaccurate.\\n \\n She told Good Morning Wales: \"Just to put the record straight, that business in the paper where it said I likened the government to Bolshevik Russia or Hitler\\'s Germany, the actual quote I gave was: \\'It is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control\\'. \"As we know from past European history, i.e. Russia and Germany in the early 20th Century, artists will go underground or leave the country or rather than compromise their expression\\'. \"Artists need a free voice to express themselves - they reflect a truth through their own art forms.\\'\" She said the assembly government was not best placed to run the arts in Wales.\\n \\n She added: \"It would be a momentous change and devastating to the arts. It would set the arts scene back 60 years, because I really don\\'t think the government has the expertise. \"If you have the National Assembly taking control, I fear you are going to be going back to the dragons and leeks and the choirs.\\n \\n \"Wales has moved on. It is international now. It is not set back in How Green Was My Valley?\" Responding to Ms James\\' criticisms, Mr Pugh said: \"The structure of unelected quangos is under review and we have made it clear that further announcements are due shortly. \"Comparing the Welsh Assembly Government to Hitler\\'s Germany is a crass and ignorant response to a real issue about democratic accountability.\" Ms James, whose father was Welsh, was born in Melbourne where her parents worked in the theatre.

       " 'Lords wrong on detainees - Straw\\n \\n Jack Straw has attacked the decision by Britain\\'s highest court that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws.\\n \\n The foreign secretary said the right to life was the \"most important liberty\" and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism. Law lords were \"simply wrong\" to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. New Home Secretary Charles Clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.\\n \\n The House of Lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government\\'s anti-terror policy.\\n \\n But Mr Straw denied it amounted to a \"constitutional crisis\". He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court. \"The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,\" he told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme. The foreign secretary insisted it was for Parliament, and not judges, to decide how best Britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the government\\'s independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. He said the Law Lords\\' ruling was an \"embarrassment\" for the government and major changes were needed to the law.\\n \\n The ruling came on Charles Clarke\\'s first day as home secretary following David Blunkett\\'s resignation. In a statement to MPs, Mr Clarke said: \"I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.\\n \\n \"In the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords.\" The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office\\'s powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. But those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. On Thursday, Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: \"Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.\\n \\n In a statement, detainee \\'A\\' in Woodhill Prison said: \"I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal \\'law\\' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones.\" The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. Solicitor Gareth Pierce, who represents eight of the detainees, claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to \"madness\", saying two were being held in Broadmoor hospital.\\n',\n",
       " 'Profile: David Blunkett\\n \\n Before he resigned the position of home secretary on Wednesday, David Blunkett had been in charge of a substantial body of government portfolios including race, policing and immigration.\\n \\n His responsibilities in running the Home Office included civil emergencies, security, terrorism and expenditure. Named home secretary after the 2001 general election, Mr Blunkett had seen the focus on his office intensify. The attacks on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 heightened concern for security and immigration in particular. A Labour loyalist from a working class background Mr Blunkett, 57, had been unafraid of pushing for tough changes to Labour policy.\\n \\n Recently the issue of identity cards had provoked controversy with questions raised over cost and invasions of civil liberties. Mr Blunkett was also at the centre of a humiliating scandal involving the former immigration minister Beverly Hughes. Having received his full backing, Ms Hughes was forced to resign in April over abuses in the visa processing system, which she claimed to be unaware of. Mr Blunkett\\'s own comments on immigration had prompted censure - he told refugees from Afghanistan and Kosovo to \"get back home\" to start rebuilding their countries. And he also urged people from ethnic minorities to develop a \"sense of belonging\" in Britain, telling them to speak English at home. Avoiding political correctness is second nature to the former home secretary, who spurns a metropolitan elite and \"airy fairy libertarians\" and earlier in the year coined the phrase \"liberati\", as an amalgam of \"glitterati\" and \"liberal\". Yet in January of this year he courted further controversy over his seemingly liberal reclassification of cannabis, from a Grade B to Grade C status drug .\\n \\n Before the recent furore, Mr Blunkett had always appeared more interested in politics than his personal life. Mr Blunkett told the Daily Telegraph in 2001 that he continued to wear his wedding ring, in spite of being a divorcee, as \"a useful way of ensuring that people don\\'t casually think I am available\". He added: \"I am not available because I am just getting on with the job.\" Mr Blunkett entered Parliament for Sheffield Brightside in 1987, after first contesting the Sheffield Hallam seat in 1974. He is one of very few blind MPs, and was the first to reach the front bench and the Cabinet. His relaxed performances - with his guide dog by his side - at the despatch box, in the Labour Party\\'s National Executive, and on the conference platform made it easy to forget his disability. Mr Blunkett himself described not being able to see as simply \"an inconvenience\". Using Braille for speeches, and briefed by his officials on tape, he also has a sharp tongue at times, and a pragmatic approach to politics.\\n \\n Mr Blunkett was schooled in Sheffield where he led the city council for seven years before entering the Commons. He chaired the Labour Party nationally, and was a unifying force in the 80s and 90s, shadowing health and education. In Tony Blair\\'s first government Mr Blunkett was put in charge of education and employment, where he won big increases in funds for schools, while insisting on improved standards of literacy and numeracy. He was prepared to stand up to the teaching unions - which sometimes heckled his speeches - and his policy of charging university students for tuition fees was not popular. In the Labour Party he has been regarded as a loyal colleague, a conciliator who avoids factions, and a man whose humour and determination make him widely popular. There have been wry smiles as well. In 1999, his then guide dog Lucy threw up in the Chamber during the speech of his Tory opponent. Lucy was replaced by her half-sister, Sadie, a black Labrador-curly-coated retriever cross, in 2003 after nearly a decade by Mr Blunkett\\'s side.\\n',\n",
       " 'Strike threat over pension plans\\n \\n Millions of public service workers could strike if ministers scrap their final salary pension scheme and make them work longer, warn union leaders.\\n \\n The Cabinet Office has confirmed it is reviewing the current pension system, prompting unions representing 4.5m workers to threaten united action. They believe the plans include raising the mandatory retirement age for public service workers from 60 to 65. The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made.\\n \\n It is thought the proposed overhaul, due on Thursday, could mean pensions could be based on a \"career average\" salary. For each year served, staff currently get one eightieth of their highest salary in the final three years. Ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the lead-up to the next general election, which is widely expected next May. In a statement on Sunday, the Cabinet Office said it was reviewing the Civil Service Pension Scheme, and hoped to announce proposals soon. \"Unions will of course be consulted about any proposed changes. \"Public sector pension schemes need to remain affordable and sustainable. People are living longer and pensions are getting more expensive. \"To maintain the long-term affordability of our pension scheme, the government announced in its Green Paper on pensions that pension age would rise from 60 to 65.\" On Monday, Tony Blair\\'s official spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister backed the plans. He said: \"What\\'s important is that there\\'s a process going on, it\\'s out for consultation at the moment, let\\'s wait for that process to complete itself.\"\\n \\n There is already widespread anger over the chancellor\\'s plans to get rid of more than 100,000 civil servants. Now public service unions are united against the plans and the Trades Union Congress is discussing the issue next Monday. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said changes to pension provisions for workers in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but would still face a raw deal. \"Members working in the NHS or for local government have never had high pay or city bonuses, but they could look forward to a decent pension - now all that is being taken away,\" he said. \"What really riles me is the breathtaking hypocrisy of MPs who recently voted themselves the best pension scheme in Europe, but say they can\\'t afford it for anyone else. \"This is a position that Unison cannot accept and will oppose. It will lead to conflict between Unison and the government, if not this year then next.\"\\n \\n Mr Prentis said workers did not want to go on strike and called for talks between unions and the highest level of government. Mark Serwotka, from the Public and Commercial Services union said there should be a co-ordinated one day strike unless there was a government rethink. The Fire Brigades Union said the government was planning to cut ill health retirement benefits for firefighters and other measures to chip away at pensions. Pensions officer Paul Woolstenholmes said: \"The pensions of millions of public sector workers are under threat - apart from MPs and judges who have the most generous pensions arrangements in the country.\"\\n',\n",

Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a \"decisive blow\" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out. A total of 3,028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study. Mr Lishman urged the next government to boost state pension.\\n \\n He also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to \"support us all in an ageing society\". \"Older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives,\" Mr Lishman said. \"Political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote.\" In the survey carried out by ICM Research, 14% of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections. Among the over-65s, 70% said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election, compared with 39% of people under 55. Age Concern says the over-55s are \"united around\" key areas of policy they want the government to focus on. For 57%, pensions and the NHS were key issues, while the economy was important for a third, and tax was a crucial area for 25%.\\n',\n",

Duchy officials, who will appear before the committee on Monday, are only responsible for generating money. The Duchy of Lancaster provides the Queen's private income, while the Duchy of Cornwall provides Prince Charles' annual income. The Duchy of Cornwall is a 140,000-acre estate across 25 counties, and also includes residential properties, shops, offices, stocks and shares. It was set up in 1337 by King Edward III to provide income for successive heirs to the throne. It covers the cost of the prince's public and private life - neither Charles, nor William and Harry, receive taxpayers' money from the Civil List. However, the Prince of Wales did receive over Â£4m from government departments and grants-in-aid in 2003-4. The duchy last year generated almost Â£12m.

The visit to Sheffield will be seen as a show of unity by Mr Blair.\\n \\n On Wednesday during Prime Minister\\'s Questions, Tory leader Michael Howard went on the offensive over comments Mr Blunkett is alleged to have made in a new biography. He is understood to have made a series of criticisms about his Cabinet colleagues from the prime minister down. Mr Howard said Mr Blunkett had complained he had inherited a \"giant mess\" when he took over at the Home Office from Jack Straw, now foreign secretary. The Tory leader went on: \"He doesn\\'t stop there: he thinks the culture secretary\\'s weak; he thinks the trade secretary doesn\\'t think strategically and he thinks the education secretary hasn\\'t developed as expected. \"He says the prime minister doesn\\'t like being told the truth and the chancellor - no doubt the prime minister will agree with this - is a bully.\" Mr Blair retorted voters remembered the record of a government and no comments by politicians.\\n \\n The home secretary has already admitted he was wrong to give the two first class tickets, given to him as an MP, to Mrs Quinn and has since paid the Â£180 back. He has apologised for \"a genuine mistake\" and says he will write to the watchdog to answer further questions. The rail tickets are meant to help MPs\\' spouses get between Westminster and their constituencies.

       " 'Student \\'fee factor\\' played down\\n \\n A rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in Scotland.\\n \\n However, Lifelong Learning Minister Jim Wallace said that this would not result in Scottish students missing out. Applications from England and Wales rose by 17% between January 2005 and the previous year, up 23,600 to 27,700. Fears had been expressed that a flood of \"fee refugees\" would try to avoid top-up fees of up to Â£3,000 a year being introduced in England. In June last year, Mr Wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for English students studying in Scotland by Â£2,000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood, although no figure has yet been agreed. Legislation to introduce the top-up fees in England is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all.\\n \\n The figures were made public on Thursday by admissions service Ucas. Universities Scotland, which represents university principals, claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to Scottish students being squeezed out. Director, David Caldwell, said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at English universities, but this was not a major factor. He told BBC Radio Scotland\\'s Good Morning Scotland programme: \"The reason people are opting for Scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality, they offer very attractive courses and Scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study.\\n \\n \"They know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in England and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to Scotland are so inflated. \"However, it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from England studying here.\" Mr Wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context. He explained that when applications were translated into acceptances, the number was not huge - an additional figure of about 200.\\n \\n Also, the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from Wales, where there are no plans for top-up fees, have also risen, by 19%. Mr Wallace said: \"Accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which Scottish higher education is held, not just in Britain. \"We want to make sure that when students are making their choice, they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to Scotland. \"We do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for Scottish students to get places at Scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option. \"Very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Anglers \\'could face prosecution\\'\\n \\n Anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of MPs has warned.\\n \\n Sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended, the environment select committee said. The MPs said they were \"concerned\" the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare. They raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved, MPs said.\\n \\n They called for a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing. The draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation, and intends to protect \"kept animals\" and \"companion\" animals by setting up a \"duty of care\". In addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences, it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible. The bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing \"mutilation\" of animals - unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal\\'s best interest.\\n \\n The environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals. One was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged - even if they were to later fail. \"We accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government\\'s intention to exempt fishing as an activity.\"\\n \\n But the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought. \"However, in exempting fishing, the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given \\'carte blanche\\' to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity,\" the committee added. The committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill, such as the law on abandonment of animals which \"would be significantly weakened\". MPs urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences. This was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted - such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect, or unnecessary mental suffering - to go unpunished.\\n \\n Committee chairman Michael Jack said: \"Any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest. \"This draft bill is no exception. My committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn\\'t just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place.\" But Mr Jack said the bill \"very much had the feel of a \\'work in progress\\', and urged the government to guarantee that \"an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law\" before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs, circuses and game bird farms. \"The government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to Parliament,\" he added.\\n',\n",
       " 'Clarke to press on with ID cards\\n \\n New Home Secretary Charles Clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for ID cards despite a call for him to \"pause for thought\" from Charles Kennedy.\\n \\n The Lib Dem leader said David Blunkett\\'s resignation was a \"good opportunity\" to question whether the legislation was necessary. But Mr Clarke said he had supported the plans when Mr Blunkett argued for them in Cabinet and he supported them now. \"ID cards are a means to creating a more secure society,\" he said. Mr Clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been \"significantly influenced\" by the recommendations of the Commons\\' home affairs committee.\\n \\n The issue would be debated in Parliament next Monday as scheduled he insisted. Earlier Mr Kennedy, whose party opposes the ID cards plan as \"deeply flawed\" said with Christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again. He told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme that Mr Clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about ID cards than his predecessors. \"Wouldn\\'t this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary, a new broom, to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place?\" he asked. Earlier this week the Tories announced they would back the government\\'s plans although Michael Howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision.\\n \\n They had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. The chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC has warned there is a real risk that people on the \"margins of society\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven\\'t [ID cards] they are going to be detained.\"\\n \\n The Home Office says people will pay Â£85 for a passport and ID card together or a undecided fee for a separate ID card. The first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill, Mr Blunkett suggested Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them. The new bill will also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents. And there will be civil penalties including a fine of up to Â£1,000 fine for people who fail to say they have moved house or changed other details and of up to Â£2,500 for failing to sign up if the cards become compulsory. The scheme will be overseen by a new independent watchdog.\\n',\n",
       " 'Scots smoking ban details set out\\n \\n Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland\\'s health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.\\n \\n He told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell said the country\\'s health rates were \"lamentable\" not least because of smoking. He said fines of up to Â£2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.\\n \\n The health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\\n \\n \\n  - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \\n  - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \\n  - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of Â£2,500 \\n  - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \\n  - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \\n  - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of Â£1,000. \\n  \\n \\n Mr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.\\n \\n The Scottish National Party\\'s Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.\" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: \"Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister\\'s brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The Scottish Green Party\\'s health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.\\n',\n",
       " 'MPs criticise child access system\\n \\n Divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system, MPs have said.\\n \\n The Constitutional Affairs Select Committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access. Courts should be used as a last resort, but where they are, their orders should be enforced more rigorously, MPs said. But they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access.\\n \\n Currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount. \"An arbitrary \\'template\\' imposed on all families, whatever the needs of the child, would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position,\" the MPs said.\\n \\n They said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in contested cases. This would \"reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children, as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety\", they said. Delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed \"a new \\'status quo\\' arrangement for the children to become established by default\", they said.\\n \\n \"Although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias, there are considerable grounds for accepting that non-resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present. \"Given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases, we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents.\" Committee chairman Alan Beith said the five-month inquiry had been a \"complex and emotive\" one. \"At the moment, far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation,\" he said. \"This situation has to change. The court system should only be used as a last resort, where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with. \"This will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country.\"\\n',\n",

The priority should instead be on \"failing states\", including Russia and Pakistan, who cannot properly control their nuclear material, he argues. His report demands a major overhaul of world rules on nuclear technology.\\n \\n Professor Etzioni was a senior adviser to President Carter\\'s White House and is the guru behind communitarian ideas which influenced the development of Blairite Third Way politics. In a report for the Foreign Policy Centre think tank, he says a nuclear terrorist attack is the main danger faced by many nations.\\n \\n \"Attempts to defend against it by hardening domestic targets cannot work, nor can one rely on pre-emption by taking the war to the terrorists before they attack,\" he says. That means there is an urgent need to curb terrorists\\' access to nuclear arms and the materials used to make them. \"We must recognise that we will be unable to stop all attacks and thus ensure terrorists will not be able to strike with weapons of mass destruction,\" Prof Etzioni continues.\\n \\n He suggests so-called rogue states such as Iran and North Korea are less of a problem than \"failed and failing states\", which are more likely to be a source of nuclear materials. He names Russia as the \"failing state\" of gravest concern as it has an estimated 90% of all fissile material outside America. And he is also worried about Pakistan after one of its top nuclear scientists, Abdul Qadeer Khan, admitted leaking nuclear secrets. Prof Etzioni criticises the US for overlooking those reports, suggesting it was done in return for Pakistani help in hunting Osama Bin Laden. \"This is like letting a serial killer go because he promised to catch some jay-walkers,\" he says.\\n \\n \\n  - Upgrading security at nuclear arms stores as a temporary measure \\n  - Creating a new Global Safety Authority to tackle nuclear terrorism, using the intelligence links established in the wake of 11 September - backed by the United Nations\\' authority \\n  - Encouraging, pressuring and using \"all available means\" to persuade countries to switch their highly-enriched uranium for less dangerous less-enriched uranium \\n  - When possible, taking fissile material away from failing states to safe havens where it can be blended down or converted \\n  - Compelling \"failing and rogue states\", and eventually all states, to destroy their nuclear bombs.\\n',\n",
       " 'Russian ex-spy on hunger strike\\n \\n An ex-Russian intelligence officer who risked his life spying for MI6 is entering the seventh week of a hunger strike near 10 Downing Street.\\n \\n Viktor Makarov, 50, claims he has been betrayed by the British authorities, who promised he would live like an \"average British citizen\". But despite a Â£65,000 settlement four years ago, he says he has been denied defector status and a decent pension. Other ex-Russian spies have been given civil service pensions. \"Hunger strike is a weapon of last resort. It can work only with determination and of course the realisation of the righteousness of your case - without that it will not work,\" Mr Makarov told the BBC\\'s Newsnight programme. \"Since I came to this country two batches of promises have been made and broken one after the other.\"\\n \\n Oleg Gordievsky, a senior KGB officer who became a secret agent for the British, said he was \"very happy\" with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985. Commenting on Mr Makarov\\'s case, he said: \"The British state is not a fat cow - it is impossible to come here and demand give me more money every week.\" But Mr Makarov\\'s case has been backed by David Kahn - a former Yale historian, and a leading expert on code-breaking, who has confirmed his information was valuable to the Western allies. \"I believe the government of the United Kingdom, which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities - took the information that Victor Makarov had, wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold,\" Mr Kahn said.\\n \\n Mr Makarov joined the KGB in 1970s Russia, as an idealistic 20 year-old. One of his fellow pupils at intelligence school was Vladimir Putin. At KGB headquarters in Moscow, he was posted to the secret 16th directorate - which decoded intercepted diplomatic traffic from the West. By the 1980s he had risen to the rank of senior lieutenant - and was privy to the thoughts of Western powers. But he had became deeply disenchanted with the Soviet regime - fuelled by its repression both at home and in Poland.\\n \\n Through his English teacher, he made an approach to M16 - and then began passing secrets to the British intelligence service. He spied for MI6 for two years before being betrayed by a friend and sent to Perm 35 - a Soviet hard labour camp in the Artic circle. Within a week of his release in 1992, he made contact with the British authorities he\\'d been spying for, who arranged a meeting between him and an MI6 agent in Latvia. He was given a false passport, and he says, promised that he would be given the chance to live like an average UK citizen. But after arriving in London 13 years ago, he feels this promise has not been fulfilled. After long periods of living in bedsits, with deteriorating health, four years ago he took legal action against the government - and settled for Â£65,000 to buy a small house. But he says he will remain on hunger strike until he receives a decent pension and the right to work, something he feels he has been denied because the authorities do not trust him. Government sources told the BBC they had reached a final settlement with the former spy, which he has been able to appeal to security and intelligence tribunals.\\n',\n",

He said first-time buyers were being \"squeezed out\" of the housing market. The Labour party said the Liberal Democrats needed to explain how they would pay for the plan. The plan forms part of a wider Lib Dems policy to encourage first time buyers and those on lower incomes into the market.\\n \\n Under the proposals, the average saving for a new buyer would be more than Â£1,000, according to Mr Cable. \"First time buyers are being squeezed out of the housing market not only by higher house prices but also by being swept into the stamp duty net,\" he said. \"By failing to uprate the stamp duty threshold Gordon Brown has hit first time buyers and those on low incomes the hardest. \"By pledging to increase the threshold to Â£150,000, the Liberal Democrats will make it possible for many first time buyers to buy a property without facing this tax.\" Paul Boateng MP, Labour\\'s Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: \"The Lib Dems\\' sums don\\'t add up. \"They can have no credibility until they can say how they would fund their ever growing list of tax and spending commitments.\" Mr Cable will publish his \"Alternative Budget\" on Monday.\\n',\n",
       " 'Kelly trails new discipline power\\n \\n Teachers could get more powers to remove unruly pupils from classes under a \"zero tolerance\" drive, Education Secretary Ruth Kelly has suggested.\\n \\n Ms Kelly told the BBC progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems. The minister also confirmed she received \"spiritual support\" from the Catholic movement Opus Dei. But she denied her faith meant she would refuse key government jobs.\\n \\n The Conservatives have made school discipline one of their five priority areas in the run-up to the next general election. Ms Kelly is expected to announce her plans on the issue in the next fortnight. She told BBC One\\'s Breakfast with Frost: \"It is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom. \"We have made huge progress on the really difficult cases, the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour.\\n \\n \"But quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled. \"I would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision.\" It is thought the plans may distinguish between excluding pupils from schools and taking them out of mainstream classes. Head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school, who sexually abuse pupils or other people, who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour. Ms Kelly entered the Cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then Home Secretary David Blunkett. Her links to Opus Dei, which means \"Work of God\" in Latin, have provoked controversy.\\n \\n Critics say the organisation, which adheres strictly to Catholic teachings, is secretive and elitist but its members reject such claims. Asked if she was a member of the group, Ms Kelly said: \"I do have spiritual support from Opus Dei and that is right. \"But those are private spiritual matters and I\\'m sure you\\'ll respect that politicians are entitled to a private life.\" She categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister. Her collective responsibility as a Cabinet minister meant she also took responsibility for policies in those areas, she argued.\\n \\n The government has yet to issue its official response to the Tomlinson review, which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma. Ms Kelly said reforms should build on GCSEs and A-levels. Her comments did not impress Tory shadow education secretary Tim Collins. \"Ruth Kelly wants to ditch the Tomlinson report on exam structures but has absolutely no idea what to put in its place,\" he said. \"She also talks of improving discipline but cannot make her mind up how. This is an all talk agenda that lets down children, teachers and parents.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Citizenship event for 18s touted\\n \\n Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.\\n \\n The idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches \"inclusive citizenship\" particularly for ethnic minorities. A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britain\\'s young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nation\\'s heritage as part of the government\\'s new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \"other cultural identities\" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.\\n \\n The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bell\\'s comments were \"highly irresponsible\". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called \\'Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society\\'. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. \"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\" said a Home Office spokesman. \"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.\\n \\n \"It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,\" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: \"But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. \"This strategy sets out the government\\'s commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.\" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.\\n \\n The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. The programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools.\\n',\n",

       " 'EU China arms ban \\'to be lifted\\'\\n \\n The EU embargo on arms exports to China is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite US objections, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has said.\\n \\n The 15-year-old ban was imposed in the aftermath of China\\'s crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square. Mr Straw told a Commons select committee human rights concerns over China remained. But he said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.\\n \\n In December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. The EU\\'s move was welcomed at the time by Beijing, which described the embargo as a \"product of the Cold War\". German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. Britain has been more cautious on the issue, but on Wednesday Mr Straw said he also wanted it to end. \"I have long understood China\\'s argument, that to lump them in with, say, Burma and Zimbabwe is not appropriate and I don\\'t think it is,\" he told the joint committee on Strategic Export Controls. He said \"it is more likely than not\" that the ban would be lifted before Britain takes over the presidency of the EU from Luxembourg in July. But he said an EU code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country. \"If it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to China as we have now.\"\\n \\n Mr Straw said the US government was suspicious of \"the motives of some other countries within the EU\" in wanting the ban lifted. But he said many of Washington\\'s objections were based on a \"lack of information and understanding\" of how export control guidelines worked in EU countries. And \"intense discussions\" were taking place with US officials to convince them it was the right thing to do. Washington is thought to fear it would lead to a buying spree for arms that could be used by China to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan. US officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the EU code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses. US Undersecretary of State John Bolton is meeting British officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo.\\n',\n",
       " '\\'Debate needed\\' on donations cap\\n \\n A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.\\n \\n Fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. In a new report, the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a Â£10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.\\n \\n There were almost Â£68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly Â£12m of them from individual gifts worth more than Â£1m. The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. \"While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,\" says its report. If there was to be a cap, it should be Â£10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned Â£56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.\\n \\n Even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under Â£200. It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to Â£3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. And it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.\\n \\n The report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from Â£20m to Â£15m. The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: \"There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. \"Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. \"The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.\" He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.\\n',\n",

The cardinal used a Christmas message to denounce the war in Iraq as a \"terrible\" waste of money. He and the Archbishop of Canterbury have both spoken out about the war.\\n \\n Speaking on BBC Radio 4\\'s Thought for the Day slot, he criticised the fact that \"billions\" have been spent on war, instead of being used to bring people \"out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease\". The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to \"make history poverty\". He added: \"If the governments of the rich countries were as ready to devote to peace the resources they are willing to commit to war, that would be to see with new eyes and speak with a new voice and perhaps then others would listen to us with new ears.\" The cardinal will touch on this theme again on Friday night when he will tell the congregation of 2,000 at Westminster Cathedral that peace is \"worth, always, striving for\".\\n \\n \"How is it that peace has not arrived?,\" the cardinal will ask. \"How is it that there is war in Iraq, violence in the Holy Land, and the horror of pain and death amongst the poor and deprived who suffer from injustice and thus do not find peace?\" \"How can one wish a happy Christmas for our fellow Christians in Iraq or in the Holy Land or those who suffer in Africa unless you and I, in whatever way is open to us, say and do what makes for peace?\" Both the Cardinal and Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams appealed for the weapons inspectors to be given more time in Iraq before the war started. Dr Williams has since criticised the government over its case for war, saying the failure to find weapons of mass destruction had damaged faith in the political system.\\n \\n On Friday, the Cardinal will ask the congregation to search for peace. \"It is possible, it is real, it is worth, always, striving for, because of the promise of Our Saviour,\" he will say. \"I also wish you peace in your homes because peace in your home is the beginning of peace in the homes of the community. \" A spokesman said Downing Street had no comment to make.

The chairman of the MCB\\'s public affairs committee, Sher Khan, said the war in Iraq would be a \"significant factor\" affecting Muslims\\' voting intentions. \"I think it\\'s going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact,\" Mr Khan said.\\n \\n However, Professor John Curtice, of the University of Strathclyde, is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by Muslims could make. \"For the most part the Labour constituencies where there\\'s a large Muslim community are relatively safe, but there are one or two that are not quite so safe,\" Professor Curtice said.\\n \\n The constituencies where Labour was most at risk from a Muslim tactical vote were Bethnal Green, in east London, and Rochdale in Lancashire, he added. In Bethnal Green, former Labour MP George Galloway, who founded the anti-war party Respect, is standing against sitting MP Oona King, who had a 10,000-vote majority in 2001. In Rochdale, the Liberal Democrats - the mainstream party a 2004 ICM survey showed was benefiting most from Muslim disaffection with Labour - secured second place in the 2001 election, securing just under 6,000 votes fewer than Labour\\'s Lorna Fitzsimons. But Professor Curtice said the Muslim anti-war vote could be split between the Liberal Democrats and Respect, meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box. \"Ironically the Tories might be the beneficiaries if Labour does lose seats, which is generally the case,\" he said. But Dr Tamimi said MAB\\'s intention was not to \"empower\" the Tories. \"We know the next government will be Labour, but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the Muslims use their vote properly. \"If the next Labour government has a reduced majority that\\'s a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country,\" Dr Tamimi said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Drive to \\'save\\' festive holidays\\n \\n Efforts are being made to \\'protect\\' workers\\' days off on Christmas Day and New Year\\'s Day.\\n \\n Support is being sought for a bill which would ensure that large retailers in Scotland remain closed on Christmas Day and 1 January. The Usdaw trade union said shop workers should be able to enjoy a break with their families. MSP Karen Whitefield wants to ensure only those whose roles are essential are at work over the festive season. In recent years, more stores have been opening on traditional holidays, with some starting their end-of-year sale on Christmas Day or New Year\\'s Day. Ms Whitefield said: \"I have found members of the public to be very supportive when I have been campaigning on the streets.\\n \\n \"The early evidence shows quite clearly that the vast majority of people believe that shop workers should be given these two special days to spend with friends and family.\" Usdaw general secretary John Hannett added: \"Christmas Day and New Year\\'s Day are special days for everyone in Scotland and the fact that shops do not open is an important part of making them special. They are largely collective days of rest. \"We want people to tell Karen, through her consultation, whether they want the special nature of these days to remain, or whether they want them to become like any other trading day, with shops open for business as usual.\" The consultation on a Christmas & New Year\\'s Day Trading Bill has so far attracted almost 500 responses and closes on 7 February.\\n',\n",

Leaving a Brussels summit Mr Blair said \"the fact Turkey is a Muslim country does not mean it should be barred\". The deal to open formal talks with Ankara came despite an EU demand for Turkey to recognise Cyprus. It was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but Turkish premier Recep Erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full EU membership.\\n \\n If it joins, Turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens. Mr Blair said having Turkey in the EU was of \"importance to the future peace and prosperity of my country, Britain, and the wider world\".\\n \\n \"We are stating a fundamental principle that the fact Turkey is a Muslim country does not mean it should be barred from Europe. \"On the contrary, if it fulfils the same principles of human rights, then Muslim and Christian can work together.\" Under the agreement, Turkey must issue a written statement promising to sign an accord effectively recognising the Greek Cypriot government, but gives Turkey more time to sell the idea to its people.\\n \\n The internationally recognised southern part of Cyprus is an EU member, but Turkey, which occupies northern Cyprus, had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country, calling the issue a \"red line\". It could take up to 15 years before Turkey is able to join, and entry cannot be guaranteed. The EU has also announced that it will start accession talks with Croatia in April 2005. However, talks will begin only if the country co-operates fully with the UN war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\\n',\n",
       " 'Guantanamo pair\\'s passport ban\\n \\n The government has written to two of the British men freed from Guantanamo Bay telling them they will not be allowed passports.\\n \\n A letter sent to Martin Mubanga said his British passport would not be issued in the light of evidence gathered against him by the US. This suggested he was likely to take part in action against UK or allied targets if he left Britain, it said. An identical letter has been sent to Feroz Abbasi, the men\\'s solicitor says.\\n \\n It is not known whether the other two men released from the Cuba detention camp in January - Richard Belmar and Moazzam Begg - have also received letters. The government is implementing the rarely used Royal Prerogative in order to withdraw the men\\'s passports. It is only the 13th time the power has been used since 1947 - the last time was in 1976. The letter, from the Home Office, says: \"I am writing to inform you that on the basis of the information which has come to light during your detention by the United States, the home secretary considered that there are strong grounds for believing that, on leaving the United Kingdom, you would take part in activities against the United Kingdom, or allied targets.\"\\n \\n The Home Office said it could not comment on individual cases.\\n \\n The Liberal Democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the US in order for the men to be allowed home from Guantanamo Bay.\\n \\n Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture. He added: \"The power should only be used in absolute extreme circumstances and I find it hard to believe that these conditions have been met this time.\" He said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the Royal Prerogative. The Liberal Democrats have promised to raise the issue in Parliament.\\n \\n Amnesty International UK also questioned whether the decisions had been based on \"torture evidence\" obtained at Guantanamo Bay. \"Furthermore, we believe there should be an investigation into the role played by the UK in the detention of UK residents and nationals and possibly many others at Guantanamo Bay,\" said director Kate Allen. The men\\'s solicitor, Louise Christian, has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture. But the Pentagon told BBC News US policy \"condemns and prohibits\" torture and said there was no evidence that any British detainee was tortured or abused. Mr Abbasi, 23, from Croydon, south London, was taken to Guantanamo Bay after being captured in Afghanistan in 2001. Mr Mubanga, 29, from north London, was originally detained in Zambia.\\n',\n",
       " 'Commons hunt protest charges\\n \\n Eight protesters who stormed the House of Commons chamber during a debate on the Hunting Bill have been charged with disorderly conduct.\\n \\n The men were arrested in September after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted. Those charged included Otis Ferry, the 22-year-old son of rock star Bryan Ferry and Luke Tomlinson, 27, a close friend of princes William and Harry. They were charged under Section 5 of the Public Order Act, police said.\\n \\n Five of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside Charing Cross Police Station on Monday evening, after the charges were formerly put to them. The men\\'s solicitor Matthew Knight, said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence.\\n \\n \"There is no offence of trespassing in the House of Commons - it is not a criminal offence,\" he said. \"If Parliament wanted to make entering the House of Commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so, but it can\\'t do so retrospectively. \"We are not prosecuted for that. We are prosecuted for a Public Order Act offence. We are not guilty of it.\" They will appear at Bow Street Magistrates\\' Court on 21 December, a police spokesman said. Otis Ferry, a former Eton pupil and joint leader of the South Shropshire Hunt, said: \"I have no regrets. \"We have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country.\" One of the men, David Redvers, 34, from Hartpury, Gloucestershire, said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges.\\n \\n The other protesters are John Holliday, 37, a huntsman from Ledbury, Herefordshire, Robert Thame, 34, who plays polo with Princes Charles in Team Highgrove, auctioneer Andrew Elliot, 42, from Bromesberrow, near Ledbury, point-to-point jockey Richard Wakeham, 34, from York, and former royal chef Nick Wood, 41. The 15 September protest came on the same day as a huge pro-hunting demonstration in Parliament Square. Four of the men ran out from behind the speaker\\'s chair while another wrestled past a doorkeeper from a different entrance. The five tried to confront MPs before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police. Three others had been intercepted by security staff as they tried to join the five in the chamber.\\n \\n Speaker Michael Martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the House of Commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder. In November, the use of the Parliament Act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in England and Wales. However, many pro-hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed, saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt. Last week, the Countryside Alliance said more than 250 hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force. The alliance said the 19 February meets would show the new law was \"impossibly difficult to determine\" and open to different interpretations.\\n',\n",
       " 'Child access laws shake-up\\n \\n Parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers. Curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied, Lord Falconer said. The constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on Tuesday. He denied fathers\\' activists had forced the changes, telling the BBC \"there is a recognition that something is wrong\". Between 15,000 and 20,000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year, although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.\\n \\n Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. But he opposed compulsory mediation, saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. Other plans include:\\n \\n \\n  - Parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life examples that have worked in the past \\n  - Extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases \\n  - Better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet \\n  - Legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes. \\n  \\n \\n Judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a \"nuclear option\" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child\\'s interests, a spokesman said. The aim of the new legislation was to provide a \"medium range\" of penalties, such as fines, community service orders, compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews.\\n \\n Failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. On the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, Lord Falconer said: \"Tagging may be going too far, but let\\'s have a debate about that.\" Full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published \"in the next two weeks,\" a spokesman said.\\n \\n The government\\'s proposals have met with disapproval from fathers\\' rights groups. John Ison, from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice, said: \"It is very disappointing. What we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation.\" Jim Parton, from Families Need Fathers, said the new proposals \"lacked compulsion\".\\n \\n \"We would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is. \"Otherwise, you see people make agreements which then fall apart.\" Mr Parton said he had been told by Children\\'s Minister Margaret Hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election, which is likely to take place in May.\\n \\n The Conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme that the government\\'s plans were \"inadequate\" and were \"papering over the cracks of the current system\". She said a Conservative government would bring a \"radical reform\" of the family courts, as well as enforcing a \"legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation\". \"We want to make courts the last resort, rather than the first resort,\" she added. The government says children cannot simply be divided up \"like property\" when a marriage collapses. The Liberal Democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules, rather than having \"rigid targets\".\\n',\n",
       " 'MPs to debate \\'euthanasia laws\\'\\n \\n MPs are preparing to debate a bill which critics claim would legalise euthanasia \"by the back door\".\\n \\n The bill would give legal force to \"living wills\", where people say they want medical treatment withheld if they become severely incapacitated. The Mental Capacity Bill has broad support from charities who say it would give better safeguards over treatment. But Christian groups say it could mean doctors withholding food and fluids even if they think it inappropriate.\\n \\n Ministers insist the Mental Capacity Bill - for England and Wales - would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life.\\n \\n The bill would establish a legal presumption that everybody can make decisions about their own treatment unless proved otherwise. It would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf, which could be challenged by doctors. Critics fear it could allow \"killing by omission\" through withdrawing treatment. An amendment to the bill - specifically preventing decisions that would bring about death - has been tabled by former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. Ninety one MPs have signed a petition backing the amendment. MPs could vote on it later on Tuesday, during the bill\\'s report stage debate. The Bill will then go to a third reading and be debated in the Lords, before becoming law.\\n \\n The Christian Medical Fellowship (CMF) and Lawyers\\' Christian Fellowship (LCF) said the Mental Capacity Bill would allow euthanasia by the \"back door\". Peter Saunders of the CMF said it believed advance refusals should be only advisory, not legally binding. \"CMF is concerned that patients will make unwise and hasty advance decisions to refuse food and fluids without being properly informed about the diagnosis and the expected course their illness will take,\" he said.\\n \\n The LCF\\'s Andrea Williams said there were \"too many loopholes that could be abused by unscrupulous doctors\". Ex-Labour minister Frank Field told BBC Two\\'s Newsnight programme there was a danger people would feel under pressure to \"do away\" with themselves so relatives could inherit their assets.\\n \\n Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy said laws affecting 750,000 people with dementia needed updating. Mr Lammy told BBC News Labour MPs would not get a free vote as the law was being strengthened, not changed. \"We are against euthanasia, we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law,\" he said. \"Doctors are saying they want more clarity. Patients are saying they want more clarity.\" The Making Decisions Alliance, which includes the Alzheimer\\'s Society, Age Concern, Mencap and the National Autistic Society, said misunderstandings over the bill had to be cleared up. \"It will not change the current law on euthanasia and will actually provide a series of better safeguards when decisions are made for people who lack capacity,\" the alliance said in a statement. The British Medical Association also backs the bill, saying it just gives incapacitated people the same rights as others. Debate on legalising euthanasia has intensified in the UK because of cases like that of motor neurone patient Diane Pretty. She died two years ago after losing a legal battle to allow her husband to help her commit suicide.\\n',\n",
       " 'Talks aim to avert pension strike\\n \\n Talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.\\n \\n Five public sector unions will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour\\'s spring conference in Gateshead. They want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. Up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 March. However, all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape. In four days, Britain\\'s biggest union Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes. Other public sector unions have pledged to follow. It is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.\\n \\n The five unions meeting Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. This would allow months of tough negotiations to follow, said our correspondent. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April. Privately ministers believe this will be the \"less painful\" option, our correspondent added. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. \"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn\\'t it ironic that they\\'re saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it\\'s completely unacceptable.\"\\n \\n Unison\\'s 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers\\' Union\\'s 70,000 and Amicus\\' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. It is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.\\n',\n",
       " 'Opposition grows to house arrests\\n \\n The Conservatives have expressed \"serious misgivings\" about government plans for keeping UK and foreign terror suspects under house arrest.\\n \\n Michael Howard said he would not back the Home Secretary\\'s plans for \"control orders\" which include home detention. \"I do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician,\" he said. The Lib Dems also oppose the proposals, but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat.\\n \\n The government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws. New Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair has backed the control orders, saying: \"I\\'m sorry. It is a dilemma, but there is only one choice.\" But Mr Howard said: \"We have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the British way of life.\"\\n \\n He argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison - not at home - while they await trial. Mr Howard said he feared \"internment without trial creates martyrs\" and could be \"a very effective recruiting sergeant\" for terrorists\". His party plans to move an amendment to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court. He called on the prime minister to \"enter into constructive discussions\" with his party to find a \"better way forward\". Controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the UK without trial or charge since December 2001 was freed from jail.\\n \\n Home Secretary Charles Clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the Egyptian man, known only as C, certified as a terrorist suspect. On Monday, the legal team for two Algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest. Most of the terror suspects are detained at Belmarsh Prison in London. The Liberal Democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure. Home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"It\\'s a matter of principle for us that we can\\'t have a situation where the Home Secretary is able to impose house detention now on UK nationals as well as foreign nationals.\"\\n \\n The Lib Dems believe the Home Secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions. \"We think there could be a role for some form of control order - tagging, surveillance, limitation on use of mobile phones - but not with the Home Secretary\\'s say so. That must be done with a proper judicial process, a judge involved in making those decisions,\" said Mr Oaten. Mr Clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk. He said prosecutions were the government\\'s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in \"serious\" cases, with independent scrutiny from judges.\\n',\n",
       " 'Visa decision \\'every 11 minutes\\'\\n \\n Visa processing staff are sometimes expected to rule on an application every 11 minutes, MPs have said.\\n \\n Pressure was placed on staff to be efficient, rather than to do a thorough examination of an application, the Public Accounts Committee found. Every officer had an annual target of 8,000 applications - equivalent to 40 a day or one every 11 minutes. MPs want research into whether UK visa holders leave at the end of their stays, or vanish into the black market. Committee chairman Edward Leigh said: \"There is a worrying tension between quick processing and proper control over the visas issued. \"Entry clearance staff are expected to deal with a visa application in about 11 minutes which is surely too little time to look closely at the supporting documents. \"\\n \\n The committee\\'s report also discussed the Romanian and Bulgarian visas scandal which led to the resignation of immigration minister Beverley Hughes last year. Committee members said the Home Office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused. Investigations carried out in the wake of Ms Hughes\\' resignation found more than 7,000 people had entered the UK under the business visa scheme for Romanian and Bulgarian \"entrepreneurs\". Mr Leigh said the Home Office should now consider removing those who had not set up a valid business. A Home Office spokesman said the system had been toughened and tightened since the investigation. He added \"that the traditional system of a dual decision making process for all pre-entry applications will be replaced by a single pre-entry check at post, which will be simpler and more robust against abuse than the current system\".\\n',\n",
       " '\\'No more concessions\\' on terror\\n \\n Charles Clarke says he has \"no desire\" to offer more concessions on his controversial anti-terror plans to get them on to the statute book.\\n \\n MPs voted in favour of the Prevention of Terrorism Bill after Mr Clarke agreed to key changes - but Labour\\'s majority was reduced to 14. The Bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. Lord Strathclyde, Tory leader in the Lords, said ministers should expect it to be \"substantially re-written\".\\n \\n The Bill proposes \"control orders\", which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. They would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against.\\n \\n On Monday, MPs voted 272-219 in favour of the Bill after key concessions from Mr Clarke. The government earlier saw its 161-strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly rejected by the Commons despite the support of 62 Labour rebels. Mr Clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the Lords to ensure the most controversial control order, amounting to house arrest, would be imposed by judges and not politicians. Lord Strathclyde warned ministers that they should \"prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the Bill\". \"They should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and I think they should drop the most objectionable proposals, which are for house arrest.\"\\n \\n But Mr Clarke told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme he believed the changes he had made to the Bill to win over critics in the Commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the Lords. \"No Bill goes through Parliament without detailed consideration being made, but I believe that what I announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the House of Lords,\" he said.\\n \\n \"I have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the Bill.\" Mr Clarke\\'s proposed amendment will be debated by the Lords on Tuesday without having been considered by MPs. The debate is unlikely to result in a vote. Speaking after the Commons debate, shadow home secretary David Davies said the bill had been \"clearly very badly drawn-up\" and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly. He said it would be possible to \"rescue\" the government and make the law \"tolerable\" by amending it in the Lords. \"The scope for miscarriages of justice is enormous,\" he told BBC News.\\n \\n Mark Oaten, for the Liberal Democrats, said Monday night\\'s vote showed the government had \"lost the confidence of all sides of the House\". He said: \"They need to rethink the bill, and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders, build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects. \"Unless there is a major movement, this bill is doomed to fail.\"\\n \\n BBC News political editor Andrew Marr said: \"I think that this is a bill in deep trouble. It\\'s been unravelling in the House of Commons - it may unravel further.\" The government wants the new bill to pass into law by 14 March, when the current powers expire.\\n',\n",
       " 'No to Royal succession shake-up\\n \\n A Labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the Royal Family the same rights as males.\\n \\n The legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the Crown. It would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying Roman Catholics. But the government refused to back Lord Dubs\\' Succession to the Crown Bill, saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues.\\n \\n The Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, agreed the 1701 Act of Settlement, which governs the succession, was discriminatory but added that \"for all practical purposes its effects are limited\".\\n \\n The changes proposed by Lord Dubs were a \"complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues\", he said. Lord Falconer said there were 22 members of the Royal Family in the line of succession after the Prince of Wales - all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act. \"It is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly. While we wish to remove all forms of discrimination... this isn\\'t the proper form,\" he added.\\n \\n He did not rule out change in the future but said if Lord Dubs\\' private member\\'s bill was passed by peers, he would urge MPs to oppose it in the Commons. Lord Dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the House of Lords, but urged the government to think again at a later stage. \"We cannot forever say we don\\'t want to change things because it is too difficult,\" he told peers. During the debate, the Labour peer and former minister said: \"The monarchy should symbolise the values of this country. \"What we don\\'t want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times. \"We are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against Catholics.\" But opponents of the bill, including Tory Lord Campbell of Alloway and the Bishop of Winchester, the Rt Rev Michael Scott-Joynt, said it would separate the state from both the Church of England and the Christian faith. Such a \"secular\" state would be markedly \"less tolerant\", Rt Rev Scott-Joynt argued.\\n',\n",

BNP founding chairman John Tyndall was arrested on Sunday on the same charge.\\n \\n In July, the BBC documentary Secret Agent featured covertly-filmed footage of BNP activists.

London mayor Mr Livingstone says he is \"standing by\" his remarks which likened an Evening Standard journalist to a \"concentration camp guard\". But the prime minister says it is time for Mr Livingstone to say sorry.\\n \\n Labour\\'s Mr Livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked. Later the prime minister said: \"A lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time, but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a Jewish journalist, yes, he should apologise.\"\\n \\n However, Mr Johnson, who was forced to apologise last year for an article in the magazine he edits about Liverpudlians grieving over the death of British hostage Ken Bigley, said Mr Blair \"should butt out of\" the row. \"I don\\'t see why the prime minister has to get involved in this,\" The Spectator editor told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme. \"It\\'s a dispute between Ken Livingstone and a reporter on the Evening Standard.\" Mr Johnson, MP for Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, said he suspected Labour was now trying to reassure Jewish voters \"because of this curious way in which Labour seems to be trying to curry favour with disillusioned Muslim voters who may be disillusioned about the war\".\\n \\n \"Ken doesn\\'t think he\\'s got anything to say sorry for and if that\\'s really his feeling, then I think that he should stick to his guns,\" he said. Mr Johnson apologised last October for perpetuating an \"outdated stereotype\" of Liverpool in the leader article on the death of Mr Bigley. The article in the magazine suggested grieving Liverpudlians were wallowing in their victim status. It also attributed blame to drunken Liverpool football fans for the 1989 Hillsborough disaster in which 96 died. Mr Johnson told Today: \"It\\'s perfectly true that I got into the grovelling game myself and when I apologised there were some things that I felt I ought to say sorry for ... there were also other things I didn\\'t think I should apologise for,\" he said. \"But here\\'s old Ken - he\\'s been crass, he\\'s been insensitive and thuggish and brutal in his language - but I don\\'t think actually if you read what he said, although it was extraordinary and rude, I don\\'t think he was actually anti-Semitic.\"\\n',\n",

It says there is \"little evidence\" the MoD\\'s performance had improved, despite the introduction of a \"smart acquisition\" policy six years ago. A senior defence official told the BBC lessons were being learned. The NAO\\'s annual report showed the total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach Â£50bn - 14% higher than originally planned. The total delays amounted to 62 months, with average individual delays rising by three months.\\n \\n Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied. \"Many problems can be traced to the fact that the MoD has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase,\" the report says. The NAO found that projects launched since the start of the scheme were showing the same worrying tendencies as the older \"legacy projects\", such as the Eurofighter. A senior defence official, speaking to the BBC\\'s defence correspondent Paul Adams, said that although the figures were still not good enough, the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle. This year\\'s overspend was significantly less than last year\\'s Â£3.1bn total, and the Defence Procurement Agency - which is responsible for buying defence equipment - was improving.\\n \\n Lord Bach, Minister for Defence Procurement, said he was \"obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown\", but insisted that the Defence Procurement Agency had \"undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects\". The latest findings follow a string of critical reports issued within the last 12 months, and, according to our correspondent, contain few new surprises. Turning around the Defence Procurement Agency \"was a little like trying to turn around a super tanker - it takes a very long time indeed\", he said. Our correspondent said it was the same projects, including the Joint Strike Fighter, the Nimrod and A400M aircraft and the Type 45 Destroyer, which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost over-runs and delay. But he added some projects, such as the C-17 heavy lift aircraft and Successor Identification Friend or Foe (SIFF), were showing good performances.\\n',\n",
       " 'Brown names 16 March for Budget\\n \\n Chancellor Gordon Brown will deliver his Budget to the House of Commons on 16 March, the Treasury has announced.\\n \\n The Budget, likely to be the last before the General Election, will be at 1230 GMT on that Wednesday, just after Prime Minister\\'s question time. The annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government\\'s taxation and broader economic predictions. It is likely to set out much of the tax and spending battleground for the election, widely expected on 5 May.\\n \\n Next month\\'s Budget will be Mr Brown\\'s eighth since Labour came to power in 1997. If a May election is called, there could be as little as 18 days between the Budget and the announcement of a date for the election. A shortened Finance Bill would have to be rushed through Parliament with all-party support to allow the Government to continue collecting revenue. The full Finance Bill, with the Budget measures in it, would then be returned to the Commons after the election, if Labour secures another term in office. As Mr Brown announced the Budget date in a short ministerial statement, accountancy firm Ernst & Young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long-term requirements of the economy. \"In the Budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections, taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and, in many cases, taxes were increased soon after the election result,\" said Aidan O\\'Carroll, E&Y\\'s UK head of tax.\\n',\n",
       " 'Asylum children to face returns\\n \\n The UK government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to Albania.\\n \\n The trial scheme, which could start in weeks, may be extended to apply to children from other countries. Children\\'s charities have reacted with alarm, saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. But the Home Office says it may be in the children\\'s best interests if it reunites them with their communities.\\n \\n The pilot, included in the government\\'s five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims.\\n \\n Since 2002, at least 9,000 under-18s have arrived in the UK to seek asylum without other family members. These children automatically become the responsibility of social services. Up to now, ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. At least a dozen Albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return, according to sources, although there is no public confirmation of numbers. Those selected could either be returned to their families, should they be traced, or placed in the care of other Albanian authorities. Separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.\\n \\n Under the 1989 Children Act, public bodies have a duty to act in the \"best interest\" of a child in their care. Laura Brownlees of Save the Children said there were grave concerns, not least because of the well-documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in Albania.\\n \\n \"If children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis,\" she said. \"We do not think there are structures in place [to receive returning children in Albania]. \\'If these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision.\" In its five-year immigration plan, announced on Tuesday, the government said it was addressing \"the difficult issue\" of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children \"and leave them to rot\". \"We are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused,\" said the spokesman. \"We have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it\\'s possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.\\n \\n \"We do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children\\'s legislation, that children who can return should remain in the UK indefinitely separated from their families and communities.\" The spokesman stressed the UK would abide by its international human rights obligations. Only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned, he said. But Andrew Hogg, spokesman for the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies. \"From what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account,\" said Mr Hogg. \"In Albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure. \"The Medical Foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries.\" A spokesman for the Albanian embassy in London said it was the first it had heard of a scheme, but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.\\n',\n",
       " '\\'Fido\\' to be taken off vote lists\\n \\n The risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote, the UK elections watchdog has said.\\n \\n Those are some of the mistakes found under the current system, where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants. The Electoral Commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud. Voters need to register by 11 March if the next poll is on 5 May as expected. But any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in Britain before that general election.\\n \\n The proposed scheme would mean voters using individual \"identifiers\" when they vote - such as their own voting number, date of birth and signature. The Electoral Commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws. Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system. There have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll, the MPs heard. And some people have registered all their family, regardless of their age - birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check. Non-British citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases.\\n \\n Mr Younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register, the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes. He argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at \"hard to reach\" voters, for example. Some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out. Mr Younger said using the Royal Mail\\'s postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters.\\n \\n He argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting. There have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form. He said it might also help register students in halls of residences, where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody. The MPs on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Constitutional Affairs select committees pressed Mr Younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover. He said the Northern Ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted. Currently, British voters have to re-register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running. Mr Younger suggested the re-registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up-to-date.\\n',\n",
       " '\\'More to do\\' on adult literacy\\n \\n The government will only hit its target for improving adult maths and literacy skills if courses are made more attractive, a report says.\\n \\n The National Audit Office praised ministers for reaching the benchmark of 750,000 adults in England gaining basic qualifications by this year. But a target of 1.5 million more by 2010 needed \"creative\" ideas. Some 26 million adults lack maths or English skill levels expected of school-leavers.\\n \\n According to the report, \"more than half\" the qualifications achieved were by learners aged 16 to 18. These are defined as \"adults\" by the government for the purpose of compiling these figures. Normally adults are defined as being aged over 19. The number of these people gaining qualifications was \"rising slowly\". Auditor General Sir John Bourn said: \"Higher levels of literacy and numeracy will benefit England both socially and economically. \"More people will have the opportunity to live richer lives.\" In 2001, the government launched the Get On scheme - aimed at reducing illiteracy and innumeracy. Sir John said \"substantial progress\" had been made since, adding that this was \"only the beginning\". The government and its partners would \"need to be creative and responsive\". Some Â£3.7bn will be spent on implementing the programme by 2006. The report recommends gathering more details on the educational needs of areas, so courses can be set to meet local demand. Existing adult learners could use their \"enthusiasm, commitment and local knowledge\" to attract other people. The Department for Education and Skills could also use more \"personalised learning\" and work with voluntary groups, councils and employers.\\n \\n It should also assess adult learners\\' progress \"at frequent intervals\", the report adds. When the government announced it had reached its 2004 target earlier this month, Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was \"only the start of the journey\". An estimated 5.2 million adults have worse literacy than that expected of 11 year olds, while 14.9 million have numeracy skills below this level. This is thought to cost the UK economy hundreds of millions of pounds each year. The qualifications achieved by those taking part in the government\\'s scheme range up to GCSE equivalents. Get On\\'s participation target has been set at 2.25 million by 2010, with an interim figure of 1.5 million by 2007. Education minister Ivan Lewis said: \"We will continue to use creative ways of involving people with the lowest skill levels and the report shows that our efforts are gathering pace.\" Shadow Education Secretary Tim Collins said: \"This is the third report in two days to highlight Labour\\'s failure to ensure young people acquire the necessary levels of literacy and numeracy for their working life. \"Employers and business leaders have repeatedly voiced concern over the number of school-leavers without these basic skills, but all the government have offered is more talk.\" Liberal Democrat education spokesman Phil Willis added: \"Far too little has been done to enable adult learners to fit learning into their busy lives.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Tory backing for ID cards\\n \\n The Tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce ID cards.\\n \\n The shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week\\'s Commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory ID. The decision follows a \"tough meeting\" where some senior Tories argued vociferously against the move, party sources told the BBC. The bill, which ministers claim will tackle crime, terrorism and illegal immigration, is expected to be opposed by the Liberal Democrats.\\n \\n They have said the scheme is \"deeply flawed\" and a waste of money. Sources within the Conservative Party told the BBC Michael Howard has always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. The party has been \"agnostic\" on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence, the Tory source said. Despite giving their backing to ID cards, the Conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.\\n \\n They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people\\'s privacy would be properly protected. \"It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,\" a spokesman said. \"It will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration.\"\\n \\n Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues\\' concerns over ID cards. \"The Tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it.\" The new chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the \"margins of society\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven\\'t [ID cards] they are going to be detained.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Labour\\'s \\'EU propaganda\\'\\n \\n A \"taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise\" on the EU is being used to lull the British public into a false sense of security, say the Tories.\\n \\n Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram told MPs a new White Paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the EU constitution. His claims were denied by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who accused the Tories of \"running scared\" of debate. EU cooperation would help get better UK immigration controls, he argued.\\n \\n Mr Straw used Thursday\\'s Commons debate to launch the new White Paper on the prospects for the EU in 2005. Security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the UK took over the chairmanship of the EU in July, said Mr Straw. Africa and climate change would also feature highly. He said the UK was trying to ensure future EU budgets were limited to 1% of Europe\\'s economic output and were spent \"where it adds most value\". Mr Straw promised to continue to ensure the UK\\'s budget rebate, secured in 1984 by Margaret Thatcher, was \"fully justified\". \"We, like all other countries, have a veto on any changes proposed in this area,\" he said.\\n \\n Mr Ancram condemned the document, which the Foreign Office says has cost about Â£2,500 to design, print and deliver. \"Isn\\'t the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new EU to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election?,\" he asked. The Tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the EU constitution would make Europe easier to understand. \"The government, last week, had to publish a commentary of 500 pages to try and explain this \\'easy and simple\\' constitution to the British people,\" he said. \"Who are they trying to kid?\" The proposed question for the constitution referendum is: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the Treaty establishing a Constitution for the European Union?\" The Electoral Commission on Thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. The government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006, with the Tories set to campaign for a \"no\" vote.\\n \\n Mr Ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. The foreign secretary hit back by saying Tory attitudes to Europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade. Mr Straw argued cooperation with European partners could bring a \"level playing field\" on immigration and asylum controls. \"You are setting your face against all of these things,\" he added. For the Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell said the UK should not ignore the need to reform the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets, he argued. Sir Menzies was among those worried about plans, backed by the UK, to lift the arms embargo imposed on China after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Mr Straw said no decisions had been taken - Chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.\\n',\n",
       " 'Hague \\'given up\\' his PM ambition\\n \\n Former Conservative leader William Hague says he will not stand for the leadership again, having given up his ambition to be prime minister.\\n \\n Mr Hague, 43, told the Daily Telegraph he would now find a life dominated by politics too \"boring\" and unfulfilling. Mr Hague, who stepped down after his party\\'s 2001 election defeat, does not rule out a return to the front bench. He also told the paper he hopes to remain MP for Richmond, North Yorks, and start a family with wife Ffion. Mr Hague, who recently had published the biography of William Pitt the Younger, also said he wanted to continue writing books and speech-writing.\\n \\n He told the newspaper: \"I don\\'t know whether I will ever go back on to the front, but don\\'t rush me.\" Asked if he would stand for the leadership again, Mr Hague replied: \"No. Definitely not.\" His determination to stay away from a central role will disappoint some senior Conservative members, who say the party needs him. Tim Collins, the shadow education secretary, said last week it would be a \"huge boost\" to the party if Mr Hague returned to the front bench. Mr Hague became an MP at 27 and Leader of the Opposition at 36. He said: \"I feel fortunate that, by the age of 40, I had crammed in an entire political career. \"I had been in the Cabinet and been leader of the party, so now I can branch out into other things...it is a very liberating feeling.\" Mr Hague added that he may have misjudged his own ambition to be prime minister. \"Maybe I wasn\\'t as driven by politics as I thought I was,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Job cuts \\'false economy\\'  - TUC\\n \\n Plans to shed 71,000 civil service jobs will prove to be a \"false economy\" that could hamper public sector reforms, according to a TUC report.\\n \\n Public and Commercial Services union members have already voted to strike over cuts for one day on 5 November. The TUC said cuts would deliver less than 6% of the Â£22bn ministers hope to save through efficiency reforms. General secretary Brendan Barber warned the \"costs could easily outweigh the benefits\". \"The government\\'s big boost to public spending is now showing results,\" said Mr Barber. \"Public services are improving but looking for simple savings through job cuts at this stage could be a false economy.\\n \\n \"They may shoot a Tory fox, but cutting thousands of civil service jobs will hit the morale and capabilities of the public servants expected to implement government reforms. The costs could easily outweigh the benefits.\" Next Friday\\'s strike action by the PCS is the biggest in the civil service since 1993, hitting Jobcentres, benefit agencies, pensions offices, customs and driving tests. The union says it is concerned about pensions, sick pay and forced relocation as well as the cut in jobs. Last month it was announced that a total of 37 social security offices and Jobcentres across the UK would close in the first wave of plans to shed civil service jobs. The number of civil servants in Britain rose to more than 520,000 in April. Other areas the strike will affect include passports, museums and galleries, libraries and health and safety inspections.\\n',\n",
       " 'UK\\'s \\'useless\\' quangos under fire\\n \\n The UK has 529 quangos financed with billions of pounds of taxpayers\\' cash - many of which are useless or duplicate each other\\'s efforts, a report claims.\\n \\n Essential Guide to British Quangos 2005 author Dan Lewis said at least 111 of the appointed bodies had been set up since Labour won power in 1997. He urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department. Tories and Lib Dems welcomed the report and called for a \"slimming down\".\\n \\n Conservative deregulation spokesman John Redwood said: \"The research endorses our policy of destroying unwanted and unnecessary quangos, and slimming down the rest.\\n \\n \"A Conservative government will axe 162 quangos, as part of its drive for more efficient and more accountable government.\" Lib Dem spokesman Ed Davey meanwhile said instead of the \"bonfire of quangos\" New Labour had promised, there had been an \"explosion\" of them. \"For over two decades, under both Tory and Labour governments, these unaccountable agencies have mushroomed. \"Liberal Democrats would abolish many, merge others, and make any that remain properly accountable.\" Labour representatives were unavailable for comment. The quango guide follows last year\\'s government-commissioned Gershon Report which recommended significant cuts in bureaucracy across the public sector.\\n \\n Mr Lewis wants a public inquiry into regional development agencies which cost Â£1.8bn a year - cash he says which \"appears to be almost entirely wasted\". As well as a departmental limit on quangos he also wants a statutory five-year limit on any such body with executive powers. He also listed what he dubbed the nine \"most useless quangos\". They were the British Potato Council, the Milk Development Council, the Energy Savings Trust, Agricultural Wages Committees, the Wine Standards Board, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, the Football Licensing Authority, Investors in People UK and the Economic and Social Research Council. Mr Lewis branded the existence of the 60-employee Potato Council, set up in 1997 to research and promote overseas potato markets, \"surprising\". He said the Â£80m spent annually on the Energy Savings Trust, which promotes renewable energy, would be better spent on eight million boiler jackets for British homes.\\n \\n And he argued it was \"absurd\" to charge farmers for Agricultural Wages Committees, which set working and wage standards in the industry, when many were prepared to take advantage of immigrant labour prepared to work for Â£1 an hour. \"If a football team can afford to pay Â£27m for Wayne Rooney, why should the taxpayer - not all of whom like football - be forced to fund the Football Licensing Authority to the tune of over Â£1.1m a year?\" Mr Lewis asked. The report is published by the Efficiency in Government Unit - a joint effort by right of centre think tanks the Economic Research Council and the Centre for Policy Studies. It says before a new public body is set up, an assessment should be made whether its proposed role is already carried out by an existing charity or other private organisation.\\n',\n",
       " 'Howard backs stem cell research\\n \\n Michael Howard has backed stem cell research, saying it is important people are not frightened of the future.\\n \\n The controversial issue was a feature of the recent US presidential election, where George Bush opposed extending it. But the Tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of Alzheimer\\'s, Parkinson\\'s and Motor Neurone disease. \"I believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses,\" he said. The use of embryonic stem cells in the UK is already allowed. Stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body\\'s tissue types. Scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney, heart or even brain tissue.\\n \\n Mr Howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research. But he argued: \"We mustn\\'t be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future. \"Politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind. \"With the life expectancy of the average Briton now around the mid-70s, society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people\\'s lives as they grow older. \"I know many people are concerned about stem-cell research. They are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls. \"I respect those concerns. But I also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like Parkinson\\'s, Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Alzheimer\\'s and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems.\"\\n \\n Mr Howard acknowledged there were \"no easy answers\" over such an issue but it was necessary to \"have the courage to do what we know to be morally right\". He added: \"Of course, stem cells are still a recent discovery. More research needs to be done. But we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown-up way. The hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved.\" Former Superman actor the late Christopher Reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident.

       " 'Howard unveils Tory asylum plans\\n \\n Tory plans to cut immigration to the UK are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees, Michael Howard has said.\\n \\n As his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, Mr Howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs. There would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. Some charities say the plans would put refugees\\' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled.\\n \\n Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans. \"By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,\" said Mr Blair. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. But he said it was \"absolutely disgusting\" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set.\\n \\n In a speech in London on Monday, Mr Howard said: \"It\\'s not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.\" He said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that \"firm but fair\" immigration controls were essential for good community relations.\\n \\n \\n  - Withdrawing from the 1951 United Nations Convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers \\n  - Introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents \\n  - Detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the UK - a worry for \"national security\" \\n  - Stop considering asylum applications inside the UK and instead take people from United Nations refugee agency camps. Anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin. \\n  \\n \\n The Tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an Australian-style points system and those wanting to join families in the UK.\\n \\n Mr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the UK every year - the size of a city like Peterborough. The plans would help achieve a \"substantial reduction\" in immigration, he said, although he could not predict a figure. He said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current \"unfair and inhumane\" system.\\n \\n \"We need to break the link between arriving in Britain and claiming asylum,\" Mr Howard said. \"By breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling.\"\\n \\n But the UN refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees. And a spokesman for European Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini said the plans would contravene EU asylum policy, which meant the UK could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. Refugee Council Chief Executive Maeve Sherlock called the plans \"dangerous, ill thought-out and hugely irresponsible\". Lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled, she warned. Commission for Racial Equality chairman Trevor Phillips said asylum applications were down 40% and economic migration down about 10%.\\n \\n He did not think Mr Howard intended to centre the debate about race. But he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture. Mr Howard called that suggestion \"disgraceful\".\\n',\n",
       " 'Campaign \\'cold calls\\' questioned\\n \\n Labour and the Conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing \"cold calls\".\\n \\n The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people\\'s voting intentions. The Lib Dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls. The information commissioner\\'s office says surveys are allowed but there is a \"grey\" area if personal data is kept. Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election.\\n \\n But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. Both schemes are run by the Direct Marketing Association and backed by EU directives on privacy and electronic communications.\\n \\n The rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies. But that does not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS. A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. But that did not happen for \"voter identification\" calls. \"When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not,\" he said. \"So it is not covered by the Telephone Preference Service.\"\\n \\n He said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no, they were not rung again. A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers. She said: \"We do apply TPS but in line with the law. We would not do things that are not allowed in the law.\" A spokesman for the Information Commissioner\\'s Office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. But the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics, not person by person. \"If a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing,\" he said.\\n \\n The spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future. The spokesman said there was \"no yes or no\" answer and the area was \"pretty grey\". He added: \"If someone complained, then we would investigate that. Political parties are aware of the regulations. At the last by-elections, we reminded them.\" Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has now written to the watchdog saying: \"The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal.\" He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are \"significant\" numbers of such calls. \"I hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases,\" he tells the commissioner. Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.\\n',\n",

But on Friday he said: \"I have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect.\" Mr McLetchie had received advice from Holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare. Labour said he had \"cleverly\" not asked about paid advocacy. A Tory spokesman \"totally refuted\" any wrongdoing.\\n \\n Mr McLetchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for Edinburgh Airport. The MSP had been a partner for Tods Murray which has a client opposing the development. Mr McLetchie did not have a complaint made against him, but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong.\\n \\n Explaining his reason for quitting the post, Mr McLetchie said: \"I have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with Tods Murray. \"However, I have no wish to see a similar situation arise again. \"To avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of Tods Murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled, I have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year. \"I am proud to have been a part of Tods Murray for the last 29 years and wish it well in the future.\"\\n \\n Labour MSP Christine May had said Mr McLetchie was \"very clever\" to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section 5 of the code. \"He was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section 6, the section on paid advocacy,\" she said. Section 5 of the members interest order legally obliges MSPs to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings \"where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner\". However, MSPs\\' Code of Conduct \"recognises a wider definition\" of parliamentary proceedings, including a non-statutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices, such as motions.\\n \\n But a letter from Holyrood\\'s Chamber Office chief Ken Hughes also made clear that Mr McLetchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor. Commenting on Mr McLetchie\\'s decision to stand down, a Scottish Labour Party spokesman said: \"This should mean Mr McLetchie doesn\\'t breach the paid advocacy rules in future. \"However it doesn\\'t change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past.\"\\n \\n Scottish National Party Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon accused Mr McLetchie of failing to properly serve his constituents. Ms Sturgeon said: \"I think this whole episode has been very damaging for Mr McLetchie and I\\'m sure he will be reflecting on it.\" She added that she thought that the Tories were an irrelevant party so she would not \"lose any sleep over it\". Peter Misselbrook, executive partner of Tods Murray said Mr McLetchie had been considering retirement later in the year. He added: \"David has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'MSPs hear renewed climate warning\\n \\n Climate change could be completely out of control within several decades, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency is warning a committee of MSPs.\\n \\n Experts are giving evidence on the subject to the Scottish Parliament\\'s environment committee. Officials believe nuclear energy and wind farms may be better options than trying to tackle global warming. Solutions suggested by conservationists include reducing internal UK air travel and boosting electric trains. The evidence is part of the committee\\'s inquiry into the impact of climate change in Scotland. Sepa is attempting to curb global warming gases, as pollution from transport emissions increases.\\n \\n Ecologists are warning MSPs that Scotland may have to accept \"significant intrusion\" from wind farms. It is likely also that nuclear power will be needed for possibly several decades. Sepa predict that the two methods will remain as energy sources until climate change is under control. Experts studying the seas off Scotland\\'s west coast have already forecast more devastating weather of the type which caused havoc across the country last month.\\n \\n They predicted that damaging storms will become more frequent. Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands and Southampton have been looking at wave heights in the Atlantic over the last nine years. The project was conducted jointly by the Environmental Research Institute in Thurso, which is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) Millennium Institute network, and the Southampton Oceanography Centre. Scientists carried out a series of studies, including the use of satellites to assess wave heights in the seas around the west coast and the Hebrides.\\n',\n",

The government gives Â£200 for winter fuel to households with people over 60, or Â£300 where people are over 80. The Tories promise to keep the payments. The Lib Dems would allow people to swap these winter fuel payments for discounts on home insulation. Shadow local government secretary Ed Davey said: \"The current scheme has helped some older people, but this new Liberal Democrat approach will go much further to end the scandal of tens of thousands of old people dying from the winter cold every year.\" The vouchers are designed to let pensioners choose from a list of approved energy supplies who would compete for business by offering discounts on home insulation schemes. The plan would boost energy conservation, says the party - and insulation could save Â£100 every year for pensioner households, so using the money more \"intelligently\" than at present.\\n',\n",

Details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. Labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. A year ago, ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and Thursday\\'s figures offer a progress check. They will say that in the past year more than 2,600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.\\n \\n Police have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders, breaking up groups of youths in public places. The 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. Exeter and Cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved.\\n \\n Prime Minister Tony Blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of Asbos and fixed penalty notices. There are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly.\\n \\n He is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed. \"We have not defeated this problem by any means, but shown together what can be done,\" he will say. Mr Blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws, saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance.\\n \\n Ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25,000 community support officers (CSOs). But researchers from Leeds University warned that CSOs could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. More work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before CSOs, they argued in a the study. Critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. Home Office Minister Hazel Blears also revealed this week that \"about a third\" of Asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.\\n',\n",

He wants to see a phased withdrawal of UK troops \"as soon as the situation allows\", he said in London. Any exit strategy must \"augment and support\" the democratic process.\\n \\n \"There are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of British and American troops in Iraq feeds the insurgency,\" he said. \"There is some truth in that, especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like Fallujah, and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces.\" Mr Kennedy pointed out that the Netherlands, Portugal and the Czech Republic, which all have troops operating in the southern sector of Iraq, have announced their imminent withdrawal \"regardless of the situation on the ground\".\\n \\n He accused Mr Blair\\'s government of \"being less than straightforward\" over its plans. \"Next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in Iraq,\" Mr Kennedy said during his City of London speech. \"He should set out a proper exit strategy, including the phased withdrawal of British troops, as the security situation allows.\" Mr Kennedy also argued that British troops deployed in Iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries - \"especially Islamic countries\".\\n',\n",

He has been criticised by the SNP for encouraging young people to get drunk. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were \"a recognition that people will get drunk\". The first minister\\'s comments came in a question and answer session at Glenurquhart High School in Inverness, attended by pupils from a number of secondary schools. A Highland councillor who was at the event has also defended Mr McConnell. Margaret Davidson, the independent member for the Loch Ness West, said the first minister was speaking in a very general way and she was sure he was speaking about adults at the time.\\n \\n When one pupil asked Mr McConnell how the executive proposed to tackle under-age drinking, began his response with the quip: \"I\\'m sure there\\'s no under-age drinking in the Highlands.\" He went on to speak about the evils of binge drinking and railed against irresponsible drinks promotions. He said: \"I hope I\\'m not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people\\'s health and their ability to control what\\'s happening round about them.\" Mr McConnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes, and on the health consequences of binge drinking. \"The one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that,\" he said. \"Far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly. \"We are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening.\"\\n \\n He added: \"By all means get drunk once in a while - but do not get into a situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly.\" SNP Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon said: \"This is an incredible gaffe by Jack McConnell. \"We all know that under-age drinking is an issue in Scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician, particularly the First Minister, should encourage young people to get drunk. \"The first minister should withdraw these remarks immediately.\" But an executive spokeswoman insisted Mr McConnell had made the remark with adults, not youngsters, in mind. \"He was talking in the context of adults binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions - which are for the over-18s,\" she said. \"It was just a recognition that people will get drunk, but that binge drinking and drinks promotions that encourage it are not acceptable.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Brown hits back in Blair rift row\\n \\n Gordon Brown has criticised a union leader who said conflict between himself and Tony Blair was harming the workings of government.\\n \\n Jonathan Baume, of the top civil servants\\' union, spoke of \"competing agendas\" between Mr Brown and Mr Blair. But the chancellor said Mr Baume was never at meetings between himself and the prime minister so could not judge. He said the union leader was trying to block civil service reform which threatened his members\\' jobs. It suited the purpose of Mr Baume\\'s union, the First Division Association, to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms, Mr Brown told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme.\\n \\n Under the plans, unveiled in the Gershon report, some 84,000 civil servants jobs will be axed or changed and the savings ploughed back into frontline services. Mr Brown said: \"To be honest I don\\'t think you can rely on his [Mr Baume\\'s] judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making. \"Mr Blair and I are making exactly the same decisions on civil service reforms. We are determined to go on with the Gershon reforms.\" He also said that as Mr Baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister, he was not in a position to judge. On Wednesday, ahead of the Chancellor\\'s pre-Budget report, Mr Baume told BBC News there were sometimes \"conflicting and competing agendas for government\" between Number 10 and the Treasury.\\n \\n What the chancellor wanted was \"not by any means what Alan Milburn and the prime minister want to see\", Mr Baume said. \"Government departments get their money from the Treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to, but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and that\\'s not necessarily the same as the Treasury\\'s and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government. \"He also sends instructions and messages and directions to departments about how he would like each secretary of state and each department to implement a policy agenda. \"The problem is that on many occasions these two don\\'t add up and individual cabinet ministers as well as departments have to make sense of this battle.\" Number 10 said ministers were interested in governing and not a \"soap opera\" about Mr Blair and Mr Brown. Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: \"The battle Royal that the top civil servants are now reporting on between the chancellor and Tony Blair is preventing them both from getting on with the business of getting taxpayers value for money.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Tories \\'would cut number of MPs\\'\\n \\n The Conservative Party would cut the number of MPs by about one-fifth if they were elected, Tory leader Michael Howard has said.\\n \\n The plan forms part of the party\\'s \"smaller government bill\", to be unveiled later this week. Mr Howard told the Sunday Times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers. And he said a referendum would be held in Wales to decide whether or not to scrap the Welsh Assembly.\\n \\n The changes would all take place within five years of the Conservatives winning a general election, Mr Howard told the paper.\\n \\n The precise number of MPs to go would depend on the result of the Welsh referendum, but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659. If Wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more MPs. Mr Howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at Whitehall - Labour by more than 80,000 and the Tories by almost 100,000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers. \"It is all very well saying government departments should be reduced, but what about ministers, Parliament and special advisers?\" he said. Shadow leader of the Commons Oliver Heald said: \"This will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people\\'s lives by reducing the size and role of the State\".\\n \\n Mr Howard said the plan would also even out the \"great unfairness\" of there being proportionately more Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster than those from England. The average size of an English constituency was 70,000 people, Mr Howard said. In Northern Ireland it was just over 66,000, in Wales just over 59,000 and in Scotland 53,000. The number of Welsh MPs would be set at an amount that was \"consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the United Kingdom\" if the assembly was scrapped. Mr Howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next. \"You have got to have a big bang. We don\\'t want this like the House of Lords reform, getting to one stage and then not having the next stage.\"\\n',\n",

The move follows a Law Lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at Belmarsh prison, London, and Woodhill, Milton Keynes, was unlawful. The 12 affected by the ruling are from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan. The government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 September to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.\\n \\n Mr Clarke told The Times: \"I think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come.\" He said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw \"in a very positive way\". Mr Clarke said that he was seeking \"memorandums of understanding\" between overseas governments and Britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. However, he added: \"I do not think the solution to the Law Lords\\' judgement for this government is in deportations, but they will help. \"There are other strands that we have to do.\" But the Liberal Democrat\\'s shadow home secretary, Mark Oaten, accused Mr Clarke of avoiding the main issue with the Belmarsh detainees.\\n \\n \"The critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle, to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future,\" he told BBC News. \"And I do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing, for example, intercept communications, telephone tapping to be included,\" Mr Oaten said. \"Deportation may tackle this initial problem but I want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country.\" \"Unless we get that, the Liberal Democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in March.\"\\n \\n The BBC\\'s home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, said it appeared Mr Clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor, David Blunkett. But he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees\\' home countries could be difficult. \"Some of these people are accused of very, very serious crimes in their home countries so it\\'s not an easy agreement to get and I think for some of these suspects it won\\'t be the solution.\" Daniel Sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions - such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process - in the next few weeks. \"The government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial,\" he said.\\n',\n",

Deputy Health Minister Rhona Brankin has pledged to study the research. SNP Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure.\\n \\n The rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the \"care development group\" of Scottish Executive experts who prepared the original costings, according to findings published in the Quarterly Economic Commentary of Strathclyde University\\'s Fraser of Allander Institute. \"Dubious\" assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another Â£130m by 2022, the report warned.\\n \\n It was carried out by husband and wife economist team Jim and Margaret Cuthbert. But Ms Brankin told BBC Radio Scotland: \"We don\\'t think we got our sums wrong. \"Obviously we will examine the findings of this new report, along with figures from our own research that we have already commissioned. \"We will look in great detail at any contribution to this, because we need to be sure we can provide free personal care and nursing care for our older people into the future. \"And we are absolutely committed to doing that.\"\\n \\n But the Scottish National Party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy. Ms Sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executive\\'s support for the policy, there were questions which needed to be answered and, if necessary, sums redone. She said: \"Serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the Scottish Executive. \"We need to know that the money is there, not just for this year or next year, but into the future so that older people, and those who are looking forward to older age, can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met.\"\\n',\n",

He is saying that prosperity means both individual wealth and ensuring \"radically improved\" public services. He is also claiming Labour is more ideologically united than ever. Mr Brown is currently touring Africa after a week of facing questions about reports of his splits with Downing Street.\\n \\n With the election widely predicted for May, angry Labour MPs this week warned Mr Blair and Mr Brown about the dangers of disunity. Now Mr Blair is trying to put the focus on the substance of Labour\\'s platform for a third term in government. Labour made low inflation, unemployment and mortgage rates the centrepiece of a new poster campaign this week.\\n \\n And on Thursday Mr Blair is saying: \"I want to talk about the central purpose ofNew Labour - which is to increase personal prosperity and well-being, not justfor a few but for all. \"By prosperity I mean both the income and wealth of individuals and theirfamilies, and the opportunity and security available to them through radicallyimproved public services and a reformed welfare state.\"\\n \\n The Tories are trying to capitalise on the apparent feud at the top of government. On Wednesday they unveiled a poster which pictured the prime minister and Mr Brown under the words \"How can they fight crime when they are fighting each other?\" Michael Howard and frontbencher John Redwood on Thursday launched new plans to abolish hundreds of quangos. They say government is spending too much and lower taxes are needed to make Britain more competitive.\\n \\n The Liberal Democrats have also claimed infighting its obstructing good government. The latest speculation about relations between New Labour\\'s two most powerful figures came after the publication of a new book, Brown\\'s Britain by Robert Preston. In it he alleges that Mr Blair told Mr Brown in 2003 he would step down as prime minister before the coming general election. The book claims the premier went back on his pledge after support from Cabinet allies and suspicion that Mr Brown was manoeuvring against him. Mr Peston\\'s book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe.\" On Wednesday Mr Blair directly denied Mr Brown made that quote, and before he left for Africa on Tuesday the chancellor told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\"\\n',\n",

Mr Mubanga, 32, from Wembley, London, said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp. The home secretary said he would not be launching an investigation and that the media reports were not \"well informed\". Mr Mubanga, who has dual British and Zambian nationality, was one of four Britons who were released from the US camp in January.\\n \\n He said he was sent there after being interrogated by a British man who said he was from MI6, shortly after his arrest in Zambia in March 2002. Mr Mubanga said he had been in Afghanistan and Pakistan to study Islam. But he said he was unable to return to the UK because he had lost his British passport, and was travelling on his Zambian passport instead. Mr Mubanga said the \"MI6 agent\" told him the passport had been found in a cave in Afghanistan along with documents listing Jewish groups in New York and suggested he had been on an al-Qaeda reconnaissance mission. Mr Mubanga said the man, and an American female defence official, tried to recruit him as an agent, but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to Guantanamo Bay.\\n \\n His lawyer Louise Christian said: \"\\'We are hoping to issue proceedings for the misfeasance of officials who colluded with the Americans in effectively kidnapping him and taking him to Guantanamo.\" And Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats\\' foreign affairs spokesman, said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved Mr Mubanga\\'s transfer to Guantanamo. But a Foreign Office spokesman said he could not comment on the activities of British intelligence or security agencies. And Home Secretary Charles Clarke told BBC One\\'s Breakfast with Frost: \"I\\'m not organising a specific investigation into it.\" Mr Mubanga is the first of the four detainees freed last month to give a media interview. He told the Observer his worst moment was when he was told he would be released last March, only to be confined and told he would be there for many more years.\\n \\n He claimed he was stripped of his clothes and mattress and forced to remain in an empty metal box, naked except for boxer shorts. And he said an interrogator used a mop to daub him with his own urine while he was chained hand and foot. Mr Mubanga, who insists he does not feel bitter, said: \"I\\'ve lost three years of my life, because I was a Muslim. He added: \"The authorities wanted to break me but they strengthened me. They\\'ve made me what I am - even if I\\'m not quite sure yet who that person is.\" The US government denied the claims, saying it condemned and prohibited torture. In a statement, it said: \"The Department of Defense has no doubt that Mr Mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war. \"He was detained to prevent him from fighting against the US and our allies in the war on terror.\" But Fair Trials Abroad director Stephen Jakobi said there were similarities between Mr Mubanga\\'s account and those of other Guantanamo detainees. He said: \"The pattern is the same. The real problem is the concentration camp conditions in Guantanamo. \"Is [Charles Clarke] really pretending this is all made up?\" Mr Mubanga and the three other freed British detainees were released without charge by UK police on their return from Cuba.\\n',\n",

The Â£3.2bn settlement includes the \"full\" Â£7.4m from the UK Treasury announced by Chancellor Gordon Brown. But opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. In addition, Â£13.4m will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. She said where spending rises were kept to around 5% she was \"confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels.\" The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) had said on the eve of the announcement said that \"significant\" cuts to services may still be unavoidable. After the announcement WLGA finance spokesman Bob Wellington, of Torfaen, said it was vital that rises were minimsed. \"A limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems,\" said Mr Wellington. \"It is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase.\" On Monday, a delegation of north Wales councils visited Ms Essex to lobby for increased funds. Ms Essex said: \"I have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises. \"I have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and I am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax, particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties.\" She said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels, \"even for those people who have moved up a band\".\\n \\n The settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. Ms Essex said: \"This is a good deal for local government, which will allow the well-managed councils of Wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. It is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level.\" Plaid Cymru\\'s local government spokesman Dai Lloyd called the announcement \"hugely disappointing\". He said: \"Wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. This is not whinging as the Labour Assembly Government so often claims - it is anger.\" \"This will mean either a massive hike in council tax, massive cuts in services provided by councils, or both.\" Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly, claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. Mr German said: \"I know from my discussions with Welsh Liberal Democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. But the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty.\" Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change \"is taking spin to the very verge of deception\". He added: \"Around a third of Welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.\"\\n',\n",

Sir Alan Budd found a \"chain of events\" linked Mr Blunkett to Leoncia Casalme\\'s indefinite leave to remain application. At the end of his Middle East trip, Mr Blair said he still admired Mr Blunkett and thought his integrity was intact.\\n \\n On Tuesday Sir Alan said the application for leave to remain in the UK made by Kimberly Quinn\\'s nanny was processed in 52 days, 120 days faster than the average. But he could not find evidence to show whether Mr Blunkett\\'s intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover\\'s nanny - or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance. In his first comments since Sir Alan\\'s announcement, Mr Blair told BBC News he had not yet read the report in detail. But told BBC News: \"As far as I\\'m concerned, we have drawn a line under that.\"\\n \\n Asked if Mr Blunkett could return to frontline politics at some point, he replied: \"I have made my admiration for David very clear and it remains. \"He\\'s been a tremendous colleague, he\\'s done a great job for us, first as home secretary then as education secretary. The future is something we will have to approach in the future.\" The prime minister shrugged off claims from Conservative leader Michael Howard that he led a \"grubby government\". He said Mr Blunkett\\'s integrity remained intact: \"He was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up. He accepted that what he originally thought had happened had not happened, he said. \"But I think Sir Alan Budd also accepted there wasn\\'t some conspiracy or cover-up and I just think a line should be drawn under now and we should move on.\"\\n \\n Earlier, Mr Howard said: \"There does need to be another inquiry, a judge-led inquiry. There were so many questions that weren\\'t answered.\" There was \"deceit at the heart of government\" which was not limited to the visa affair, he argued. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also said there was \"a strong case for a judge-led judicial review\".\\n \\n He said: \"Next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. It may be about something even more important than that.\" Mr Blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of Sir Alan\\'s findings. In a statement, the ex-home secretary said he accepted the inquiry\\'s findings. He said he had told the truth throughout and had raised the nanny case as an example of unacceptable backlogs in the system.\\n',\n",

Minister for Children, Young People and Families Margaret Hodge said new plans will ensure fosterers\\' allowances would be as fair as possible. However local authorities, which set and pay the allowances, are concerned about how the extra cash will be found. About 50,000 children live with foster families in the UK and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet.\\n \\n Ms Hodge said: \"Foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child - a crucial role in society. \"We need to make sure that arrangements for paying foster carers are as fair and transparent as possible. \"Our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity.\" The government is seeking to amend the Children Bill, which passes through the Commons next week, to establish a national minimum payment.\\n \\n Fostering Network executive director Robert Tapsfield criticised the existing system. \"There is just no logic to a system which values children differently depending on where they live. \"And with a shortage of over 8,000 foster carers in England, it\\'s not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets.\" The charity recommends a weekly payment of Â£108.49 for looking after a baby. In a survey, it discovered that rates paid by neighbouring authorities could vary by as much as Â£100 per week.\\n \\n The Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) said it agreed in principle with the government\\'s plans. Tony Hunter, the organisation\\'s president, said: \"There are many devils and lots of details hidden within the Government\\'s proposals. \"But ADSS fully supports proper remuneration for valued foster carers and looks forward to working with ministers, local government and the fostering organisations themselves in order to make sure a sensible and practicable policy emerges.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Royal couple watch nation\\'s mood\\n \\n Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles are awaiting the nation\\'s reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 April.\\n \\n Mrs Parker Bowles will take the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at Windsor Castle. A Daily Telegraph poll of 1,313 people suggests two-thirds of Britons support the couple\\'s decision to marry. But only 40% think Mrs Parker Bowles should become Princess Consort as planned after Charles becomes king. Some 47% believe she should have no title, while 7% think she should become queen.\\n \\n The poll also found that the majority of Britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation, with the Queen handing the throne to her grandson Prince William, 22, on her death or abdication. On Thursday night, Prince Charles, 56, and Mrs Parker Bowles, 57, hosted a dinner at Windsor Castle, their first public appearance since announcing their engagement. Mrs Parker Bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added: \"I\\'m just coming down to earth.\" She displayed her diamond engagement ring - a Royal Family heirloom - to reporters. Charles said he and his wife-to-be were \"absolutely delighted\". Their marriage will end years of speculation on a relationship which dates back to 1970.\\n \\n The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh said the news had made them \"very happy\". Princes William and Harry said they are \"very happy\" and wish the couple \"all the luck in the future\". The wedding will be a civil ceremony followed by a service of prayer and dedication in St George\\'s Chapel at which the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, will preside.\\n \\n The marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because Mrs Parker Bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive. If he became king, Charles would be the supreme governor of the Church of England and some Anglicans remain opposed to the remarriage of divorcees. \"His divorce from Diana and the disappointment the country felt over how Diana had been treated... opened up a sense of disillusionment with [Prince Charles],\" said Ros Coward, who wrote the authorised biography of Diana, princess of Wales. The Archbishop of Canterbury said: \"I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step.\" Tony Blair said he was \"delighted\" for the couple and offered his congratulations, as did Conservative leader Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. Australia\\'s Prime Minister John Howard also offered his congratulations, adding that their decision to marry was a \"sensible and a good thing\". Mrs Parker Bowles has joined the prince at numerous engagements in recent years - mostly at evening events for The Prince\\'s Trust. Clarence House staff were at pains to point out that she attended these events in a private capacity.\\n',\n",

franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent example of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scot are good at and support our own good ! i think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque should be looking for government subsidy i know that if i wa lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i wa in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship yes the government should fund music it brings joy to the mass there are already thousand of state funded musician out there sitting around twiddling their thumb on the new deal getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use a long a the government wa funding real talent it would be a great move i would hate to see more pop idol type funding of music though a it would only serve to reinforce the stereotype that alex talked about only if the proposal make financial sense franz ferdinand must be paying serious amount of tax on their record sale if they had a government grant to get started they have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out however the government ha better thing to spend it money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they a musician the government should fund music it should invest in music and those investment should be treated like any other investment i think the government need to provide facility and for young group and band to form and practise the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the mean of many people however i do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the condition for the talent to flourish and let it go from there i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record company !

! ! best song in year you must be joking it good if you like that sort of thing but really ! listened to angel on radio this morning when i wa driving into work had not heard it for a while i love robs voice the lyric and tune perfection ! a usual the public have short memory when it come to voting for the greatest there must be more than a dozen song in the last year that deserve this award more it not exactly groundbreaking presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low im actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last year ! ! what about the special ghost town the buzzcocks ever fallen in love with someone happy monday kinky afro mcalmont butler yes joy division love will tear u apart angel is middle of the road rubbish angel is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap it musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself this result is very surprising though the brit ha a long history of celebrating rubbish music ! best of the last year maybe cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it doe kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really not much competition in the last year after all it alright for a pop song but the best song of the last year there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last year it a travesty rubbish ! who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio but i do recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the mass who would know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last year how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop wa on the way out where on earth did this dreadful list appear from while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear u apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last year should not include song le than year old a that would exclude song which are popular because of novelty then again well done robbie good show you got to be kidding angel is a great song but not the best song of the last year only the best song to be up for nomination at the brit i think angel is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i do think it the best song from the past year ! right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what wa will young doing being nominated in the first place he is alright but the song is that good ! im happy for robbie himself though ! best song in the last year what a joke ! think of all the great rock and pop song released in the and pretty much all of them are better than angel phil collins doe deserve award for all the good song he wrote angel is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it soppy rubbish at best hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artist who worked hard for there glory receive award so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me it proof that music and democracy just do mix still at least it wa will young oh it all just a bit of fun people take these award too seriously ! robbie ha million of loyal fan while even non fan know the word to angel him winning obviously reflects who vote in these award personally i wanted will young to win but that wa not really due to his musical talent ! i hate the song all it brings back is memory of school disco and no one to slow dance with ! i agree about angel i never get fed up hearing it whenever the song come on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio ha to be turned up to drown my voice out the song make me calm and serene and happy well done robbie i think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angel is really that good a song it certainly is anywhere near a good a love will tear u apart by joy division or wuthering height by kate bush angel is a fantastic song all credit to robbie williams and guy chamber it a song that will be played forever and bridge all age group robbie did in no way deserve that mantle whenever we have these award it is always artist from the past five year that seem to win the best of the best we forget about the late and early for example they were cool at the time but because they are cool again now show that the song have greater longevity than people think yes angel is the best song since the past year because it touch the soul a it carry a lot of meaning i always disliked angel intensely i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre teen teen and middle aged woman to accept low quality low aspirational music a classic songwriting it orrible it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who do particularly like music all that much folk without collection folk who have never engaged in that madness one experience when falling under the spell of pop music angel add nothing it is merely an irritating distraction a wasp that refuse to go away on a summer afternoon picnic what a dreadful result if you voted for it you should feel ashamed of yourself you probably only know a dozen song or so do you so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote booo hiss angel best song you are kidding right last five year i might be willing to accept but no way did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century no surprise about robbie williams considering the list where on earth did the nomination list come from compiled by an eleven year old girl perhaps i mean will young come on what a load of crap best song in the last year i do think so ! ! what about all the real artist out there over the last year the list is endless but robbie williams doe even come close what a joke that song ha become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angel where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tell me the radio off why a half baked cheesy ditty like angel which ha become the anthem for million of romantic sop think how many time it wa sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past year is beyond me if this is the song against which all others are judged then musician may a well give up why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list wa very weak anyway but angel the best song of the last year ! ! ! ! i think not i did realize radio had so many listener under the age of ! ! people have such short memory ! a great song yes but the best of the last year not a chance i think the person a opposed to the song ha been voted for here the great british public at work again it a mediocre sentimental and safe song granted it not too bad either but can it stand up against anything by the smith in particular how soon is now or anything from the stone rose first album nope no because im not female and im not ! ok i like robbie and angel is a decent song but it is no way the best song of the past year ! the shortlist wa great but him winning it is a joke ! predictable and laughable the success of angel at this year brit reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last year the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them a cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed whilst angel is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie repertoire never mind best song of the last year i am a huge robbie fan and love that song but i think there are a lot more outstanding song music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the list have radio listener even heard of joy division a band who through two album have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last year than robbie williams ever will no doubt about it there not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling some people will adopt their slightly snobby stance but angel ha hit home with a far larger audience than any other song it should have been joy division those guy have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angel remains yet another pop song i sincerely do not believe that in year from now the most influential artist will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrd the beatles and nick drake have done for music today yes ! ! i think it a brilliantly written song with different meaning to different people there were other great song in the category but somebody had to win ! robbie wa a deserved winner i am astounded that such a second rate record ha beaten such a line up of amazing song ! it a terrible song voted for by the mass who do have the brain to appreciate innovative and exciting music the best song of the past year really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie down it just go to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division i suppose it confirmed one thing the british public are consistently dull lt no offence robbie but pleeease ! there must be a thousand better song than a formulated cheesy pop song for kid no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffin ! i think robbie deserves it he ha been the most iconic of any star we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to million worldwide anybody who say he doe deserve it is jealous of his success the only real challenger wa queen but hey another one bite the dust ! ! obviously all the karaoke singer in the uk voted for it if this is the best song of the last year then the british music industry is in trouble sure robbie is talented and produce excellent material but this is not the best record a sad day for music it not the type of music i normally like but even a a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people that why it ha been voted best song of the last year it a good all rounder just like robbie best song in year since im confused angel is a bad song it a nice catchy formulaic anthem that tick all the box but this is not great music if anything it regressive bland even i suppose it just more evidence of how redundant the brit award have become granted angel is a good song however it really wa up against any other proper competition the queen song wa lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choice were pathetic ! also why were the stone there david bowie etc there are so many greater song than angel i wonder if it wa simply the fact that robbie wa getting more award so they had to make one up for him ! best song of the last year what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner sigh on the upside at least it wa bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful angel is without doubt a great song but i really do think it deserves the title of best song in year perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song ! ! ! do get me wrong im not disputing his look but there are more deserved winner it would have been a travesty had angel not won without angel robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of it most charismatic and talented performing artist it ha to be seen performed live with people singing along to be fully appreciated well done rob i find it hard to believe that angel is the best we have to show for the past year ! im rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at wedding and funeral because people think it ha deep meaning what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp not only making fantastic song but also making change doing something different why must best always come down to most commercially popular i nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last the brit ha proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop mogul to boost band profile and record sale the same go with the scissor sister i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album come no where near u new record neither are they in the same league once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reason but for profit no surprise really it voted for by the general public since when did they have taste in music personally i find angel by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating song i have ever heard ! it absolutely deserved to win it is a song that ha united the generation and will continue to be played for many year to come it an absolute joke however most of the original were very poor choice a well all in all a pretty pointless exercise ! the song is overplayed and oversentimental out of the rather poor five choice that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen i suppose we should be thankful that it did end up in the hand of will young though although it ha nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win everybody know the word to bohemian rhapsody nothing compare u etc much better song and more timeless give it to someone with real talent although angel is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last year this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trouser if that all it mean !',\n",

that joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hip hop soul funk at least but not rock or pop this year it the street although dizzee rascal stake a good claim she definitely deserved to win a prize joss stone album are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that wa released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artist who were nominated or did win i cant see why people ca just congratulate her for the talent that she is she did deserve it but i agree with the comment about urban music it a stupid phrase and particularly british in the state they tend to use hip hop and r b if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what im talking about very strange what in a name a rose by any other name etc if people want to call it urban why not if we really analysed it the term ance music is misleading because it doe describe everything you can dance to whilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strike me a simply weird that joss stone ha won urban to me is what i hear being played in party in the inner city i live in brixton and have never heard the soul session pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any party i been to good luck to joss stone let celebrate her victory let also question why with artist so successful and talented a jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia key and outkast we did see a single black artist on stage collecting an award so what you saying is that any music that ha black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who is black and if it is then they should be acknowledged for it even if they pretty dam good at it she ha an amazing voice and won good on her oh but she not black well let make her feel real bad about it then how dare she ! though hang on did the so called public vote on this one this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what wa happening in the and in relation to what jazz wa the medium then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz much to the chagrin of the artist it would mean that blue would be put in the same mould a bebop cool and ragtime all very different style at that time jazz wa and remains such a massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music in truth it a lazy term to categorise music that you do really understand soul and garage are world apart musically marvin gaye v tuff jam but no doubt have their connection if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of award won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents i demand a prize for rural music ! suck to the city it way better out here we have hay for one thing excluding her from what ha become known a urban music would be a bad a excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely i dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who make music which is le soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing btw im black too how can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside nonsense i love joss to bit and do care what her branding is it amazing music full stop stop puting it all in bracket and let just call it music and let especially drop the black urban tag nearly all music came from black origin this just set an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artist that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just a someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person wa good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to a country music or the artist for representing that style the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk ha developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo award the very term music of black origin ha confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music award it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music make people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore ha been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now a redundant new debate a to what urban also mean perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strain of soul rnb and hip hop one which doe not also mean something else a we have done with crunk urban is just a word that come about recently to describe black music that become popular now the word wa even in use or common use five of six year ago it just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it im in a band that ha been called urban and i despise the label i hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because that all it is ever since the music channel and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these label have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcaster unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack a if it some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the label it is what it is just music a a black man i think i agree with some of the statement at least the statement made by the key executive black people should lead the music they invented we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she wa doing if she were black same thing with street amy winehouse etc who ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson they are both time better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music award and i think mobos but why not brit so what if joss stone won the urban award her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner what if the street had won would people be whining because mike skinner is white it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else urban is pc version for saying black music im not doubting m stone talent but why did jamelia or lemar get a brit this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nomination are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comment on any topic these day more power to you people ! you have said it there is music you like and music you do like who care what label you put on it that entire category wa a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone it like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british r b act joss stone deserved to win an award for her talent but i do think it wa very urban of her to sing angel with robbie williams urban is a nonsense term music of black origin well doe that include rock music made in the inner city well almost all band end up making music in london manchester etc and doe that make some weird implication that all black people live in city it doe make any sense why doe music have to be put into a genre it music you like it or you do simple a that i play in a heavy metal band we are urban music a far a im concerned we live in city and spend our working life in an urban environment it therefore directly shape what we write musically urban seems to be the new name for all style of black music why it needed a rebrand i do know a the name is misleading oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet a they a white rock band they wo be described a such joss stone ha a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery what other reason do they need to award her the brit all this urban and other such categorisation is just the red tape of the music business and is best ignored yeah she deserved it she is talented urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though there only two kind of music good and bad',\n",

in the u replaces the stop motion model of the tv show with polished computer generated animation in a similar fashion the thunderbird used human actor and special effect in place of the original puppet and model the film are squarely pitched at younger audience pop star robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voice in the magic roundabout while the now defunct boy band busted performed the thunderbird theme song but while some reviewer have been won over there ha nonetheless been a significant backlash this cg animated adventure airbrush the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the stop motion roundabout a cult hit writes stella papamichael on the bbc movie site and the recent puppet comedy team america world police wa in part provoked by it director outrage that gerry anderson thunderbird wa remade without it signature mannequin dan jolin review editor of empire magazine say classic child tv show have a built in audience that make them ideal for reinvention i can understand why people are taking these intellectual property and repackaging them for the kid of today but i think it backfiring what next the clanger on some distant planet with some giant cgi soup dragon chasing after them despite thunderbird disappointing global box office performance the film cost but only recouped the nostalgia craze show no sign of abating it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourite receive the hollywood treatment after the success of garfield the movie britain shabby tabby surely deserves his own film vehicle with only episode made of the series there is plenty of room to explore the life of the pink cat professor yaffle and the mouse of the marvellous mechanical mouse organ furry recyclers have already had one big screen outing wombling free but with environmental issue still occupying our thought it is high time they made a comeback advance in special effect technology could do wonder for the bbc supernatural comedy and the success of pirate of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tv most popular cartoon buccaneer it might also remind viewer the lewd character name often associated with the show never actually existed the magic roundabout is out in the uk on february how about bringing catweazle to the big screen he could give gandalf a run for his money ! thundercats ! ! i loved it should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in ! it will bring my youth back ! get your hand off the clanger ! is nothing sacred make a movie version of the banana split ! what about keanu reef and richard gere in a remake of the wooden top or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy you forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse ! but then again it could be better than the original series could it it always nice to see these old toon re released but after the abysmal thunderbird movie and the song ! i think i been completely put off just leave these classic alone a good memory i think remake are a good idea a the world move on people tend to look more and more into the past to thing that make them feel safe i believe this is the whole reason retro ha become so popular a long a a remake doe justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of person to enjoy and revive and old series personally i like to see cartoon such a transformer thundercats and m a s k get full hollywood remake leave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memory of in the first place the thunderbird film wa apalling not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson love to see transformer with real actor and cgi and make it at least a rating part of the reason for the success of such classic a the magic roundabout wa that the character were not the sweet and cuddly creature that you would expect they were moody sarcastic and rather human just looking at the picture of the animation for the new film show that these characteristic have not been preserved dougal never smiled like that ! film of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place i have fond memory of bod not least of which because i look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film it got all the right material for an american blockbuster no plot and no story bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two it all very well and good remaking these classic tv show and film with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the original they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these show such a thunderbird and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation it doe pose the question though that with all the long line of remake being made are film maker running out of original idea all i can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kid show ever i recently re watched some episode and realised that there wa a level of humour shown in danger mouse that wa completely lost on me when i wa a child there wa a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of year back again like so many of these nostalgia programme the animation this time computer created flat cell like animation failed to match the original cut out paper technique for inventiveness and wa woefully inadequate we live in a sampling world the music industry ha been pludering past decade for inspiration clipping sound from year ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new seems that the film and tv is doing the same now it just cheaper to take idea from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something new it got to be mr benn the story line about a man who change in a fancy dress shop step into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing ! if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great and who to play the lead role well if it wa a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin if it going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirate of the caribbean character muffin the mule perhaps after all granny and grandpa go to the cinema a well you know ! why ca the british film industry try making gerry anderson ufo or captain scarlet or saphire and steel or the tomorrow people in today medium it seems the past is the future tv show such a battlestar galactica have new remake dj are sampling or re working and music even computer game from year ago are getting modern re working personally i think it show that no one ha any originality any more ! why not just leave our misty eyed nostalgia alone mary mungo and midge but of course for most of the episode the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stair plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character a she life in a high rise council block yeah but no but i wa even there ! i like to see mr benn with brad pitt in the title role sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today film maker that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia there are plany of modern child book that would make excellent film or tv programme why not use them instead of rehashing the past mr benn with rowan atkinson a the lead would have loved to see dungeon dragon made but unfortunately the film that it wa made into did come up to scratch the only one that is to be remade a yet is thundercats which i like to see im an expat living in norway and i recently went through a period of buying the dvd of many of my favourite child program for my daughter my dearest wish however is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen ! ! very scandinavian rainbow ! i believe that childrens classic should be left well alone and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout doe not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among child because it original witty and modern the magic roundabout will never appeal to the child of today a it did all those many year ago how about classic like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bod oh the list could go on and on ! ! ! if a transformer movie is indeed on the card then i be the first one on amazon buying a copy eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price ! i do care ! till then i have to make do with the citreon c advert i luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voice it wouldnt be the same and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden superb child programme could morph hold his own in a big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torch hmmmmm i could go on and on danger mouse at im showing my age noggin the nog wa one of the best child program the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no one could approach oliver postgate wonderful voice so in general leave well alone the original are good because they are of their time and the method used are an integral part of the story just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs the already disturbing hand antic of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life like fingermouse bob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and brick in the ultimate struggle to save the woman they love from the evil clown krusty and gobo will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fall one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joe car of course gerry anderson supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big screen big budget action it wa only that thunderbird the movie wa targetted a a childre movie that really let it down after all the child that remember those show with such affection are now the parent of child themselves it only because the people who were child when these programme were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhood is it i hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation i love that one in a shed clunkiness and you could recreate the magic perhaps if the remake were done in a look around you mock authentic style i might be interested chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be mega ! this re gurgitation of old film and tv show make me angry it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people idea because it guarantee to bring in the the same can be said of modern day pop band who release other people material will young etc the sad fact is nostalgia sell big buck in the short term the fact that they will be forgotten in month time is irrelevant e g starsky hutch hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it ! i pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies im only and do remember the series from when it wa on tv but have the set on dvd and it a classic the fact it so great come from the fact that there were very few special effect involved and compared to today stuff it look amateurish thats the appeal though it so innocent like chorlton himself and it would be a real shame if they did remake it',\n",
